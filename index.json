Students are assumed to have some background in statistical concepts and have a basic understanding of common descriptive statistics and bivariate association (e.g., Pearson correlation).\nThis course will focus on using statistical methods to answer research questions and make decisions from data. General linear models (i.e., regression) will serve as the fundamental building block that students will be exposed to answer questions about associations of quantitative outcomes with quantitative and categorical predictors. Statistical estimation, model building, and inference using statistical software will serve as primary topics which students will gain a stronger understanding by the end of the course.\nCourse Objectives The course requirements and class materials are aimed to help students achieve the following course objectives:\n become more fluent in statistical terminology, use statistical software, turn research questions into actionable statistical methods, engage with statistical theory, connect model equations with statistical code, summarize uncertainty and variation in estimation.  Textbook  Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd edition), by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani: https://www.statlearning.com/ Supplemental Text:  Statistical Reasoning through Computation and R, by LeBeau and Zieffler: https://lebebr01.github.io/stat_thinking/ Introduction to Modern Statistics, by Cetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. Found online here: https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/ Applied Regression: An Introduction, by Lewis-Beck and Lewis-Beck. Online access via library: https://dx-doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.4135/9781483396774.n1.   Class notes and Jupyter Notebooks used in class will also be shared through the course website.  Course Requirements   Online Quizzes: There will be a total of 10 online quizzes taken through ICON. Each quiz will be available for 5 to 7 days and are open note/book, but should be completed independently and will need to be completed in a single occasion. Expect each quiz to be about 10 questions. The dates will be discussed in class and announcements will be sent by email to communicate when quizzes open and close. Quizzes will account for 40% of the course grade.\n  Assignments: 4 assignments spread throughout the course will be used to improve student understanding and give students practice to work with data. These assignments can be completed within small groups of no more than 3 students. If completed as a group, all students will receive the same score and only one assignment with everyone\u0026rsquo;s name on it needs to be turned in. Assignments will account for 40% of the course grade.\n  Activities: Approximately 6 activities will be posted across the semester. These are complete/incomplete activities, therefore, completing these will give you 20% of the final course grade. Completion of these involve posting answers to the questions that show you interacted and engaged in the activity. Answers that are not on topic or missing will not count as \u0026ldquo;passing\u0026rdquo; for that activity. These activities are meant to be formative assessments to give you time to practice interpreting statistics. Similar to the assignments, you may work in groups of up to 3 to complete these activities, in which you would all receive the same pass/fail grade for the activity.\n  Absences: Absences happen. Therefore, I ask you to be as transparent as possible with me. I promise to be compassionate and understanding. If at any point in the semester you are having difficulties, please reach out to me and I will do my best to be accommodating and provide support, which could include an extension on course deadlines as necessary.\n  Grading: Final grades will be based on the following weighting scheme:\n 10 quizzes, equally weighted, 40% of total grade 4 assignments, equally weighted, 40% of total grade About 6 activities, equally weighted, 20% of total grade    Percentage Breakdown: Guidelines are given below, plus and minus grades will be given as well. Changes may occur to the grade percentage breakdown below, but the percentages will not get higher. For example, the lower percentage to get a B, could drop to 75%, but will never be higher than 80%. I will do my best to communicate any shifts to these grade ranges as the semester progresses.\n A 90% and above B 80% up to 90% C 70% up to 80% D Below 70%    Course and University Policies  Announcements and Communication: Any announcements regarding the course will be communicated via email so please check it daily.  Email Expectations: I want to be transparent regarding course email. Email is not meant to be an instantaneous exchange, rather, email is asynchronous. I typically will respond to an email within one business day. Note, I typically will not respond to email over the weekend or during evening hours, but there could be exceptions to this. If I do send an email during the evening or weekend, there is no expectation that you reply immediately as well. If a reply is warranted, reply on your own time. Please be advised that this applies to all elements of the semester, even around due dates. If you email a question the day an assignment is due, I may not be able to get back to you until the next day   Course Materials: Course materials will be posted to ICON or the course website. Go to icon.uiowa.edu for access to the ICON site and the primary course website for PSQF 6243. Adaptations and Modifications: Please inform me during the first two weeks if you require special adaptations or modifications to any assignment or due dates because of special circumstances such as learning disabilities, religious observances, or other appropriate needs. Contesting a Grade: To contest a grade, please send me an email detailing your reason within 48 hours of receiving the grade. This allows both of us time to think, reflect, and discuss the matter without taking class time from other students. When contesting a grade, provide a copy of the graded assignment. Academic Misconduct: Plagiarism and cheating may result in grade reduction and/or serious penalties. Unless you are otherwise instructed, your work should be entirely your own. Please take care in writing your final project. You should always be writing in your own words, citing others' ideas, and quoting text as appropriate. This link provides the College of Education policy on student academic misconduct. Student Complaint Procedures: The College of Education policy on student complaints about faculty action Use of AI: Students are invited to use AI platforms to help prepare for assignments and projects (e.g., to help with brainstorming or to test your own knowledge about specific course topics). I also welcome you to use AI tools to help revise and edit your work (e.g., to help identify flaws in reasoning, spot confusing or underdeveloped paragraphs, or to simply fix citations). If you use AI tools to aid in writing or editing any written material you submit for the course, please make sure you cite the tool and indicate how you fact checked the material.  University Policies The following University of Iowa course policies are published by the Provost office.\nAt the University of Iowa, we strive for a classroom or laboratory climate that encourages learning while also protecting the freedoms and rights of our students and faculty.\nPlease review the following course policies, expectations, and resources. Visit the Dean of Students website for additional student policies and procedures.\n Free Speech and Expression: The University of Iowa supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principles of academic and artistic freedom. We are committed to open inquiry, vigorous debate, and creative expression inside and outside of the classroom. Visit the Free Speech at Iowa website for more information on the university’s policies on free speech and academic freedom. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University is committed to providing an educational experience that is accessible to all students. If a student has a diagnosed disability or other disabling condition that may impact the student’s ability to complete the course requirements as stated in the syllabus, the student may seek accommodations through Student Disability Services (SDS). SDS is responsible for making Letters of Accommodation (LOA) available to the student. The student must provide a LOA to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, but requests not made at least two weeks prior to the scheduled activity for which an accommodation is sought may not be accommodated. The LOA will specify what reasonable course accommodations the student is eligible for and those the instructor should provide. Additional information can be found on the SDS website. Absences from Class: University regulations require that students be allowed to make up examinations which have been missed due to illness, religious holy days, military service obligations, including service-related medical appointments, jury duty, or other unavoidable circumstances or other University-sponsored activities. Students should work with faculty regarding making up other missed work, such as assignments, quizzes, and classroom attendance. Absences for Religious Holy Days: The University is prepared to make reasonable accommodations for students whose religious holy days coincide with their classroom assignments, test schedules, and classroom attendance expectations. Students must notify their instructors in writing of any such Religious Holy Day conflicts or absences within the first few days of the semester or session, and no later than the third week of the semester. If the conflict or absence will occur within the first three weeks of the semester, the student should notify the instructor as soon as possible. See Operations Manual 8.2 Absences for Religious Holy Days for additional information. Absences for Military Service Obligations: Students absent from class or class-related requirements due to U.S. veteran or U.S. military service obligations (including military service–related medical appointments, military orders, and National Guard Service obligations) shall be excused without any grading adjustment or other penalty. Instructors shall make reasonable accommodations to allow students to make up, without penalty, tests and assignments they missed because of veteran or military service obligations. Reasonable accommodations may include making up missed work following the service obligation; completing work in advance; completing an equivalent assignment; or waiver of the assignment without penalty. In all instances, students bear the responsibility to communicate with their instructors about such veteran or military service obligations, to meet course expectations and requirements. Classroom Expectations: Students are expected to comply with University policies regarding appropriate classroom behavior as outlined in the Code of Student Life. While students have the right to express themselves and participate freely in class, it is expected that students will behave with the same level of courtesy and respect in the virtual class setting (whether asynchronous or synchronous) as they would in an in-person classroom. Failure to follow behavior expectations as outlined in the Code of Student Life may be addressed by the instructor and may also result in discipline under the Code of Student Life policies governing E.5 Disruptive Behavior or E.6 Failure to Comply with University Directive. Non-Discrimination Statement: The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination in employment, educational programs, and activities on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, pregnancy, disability, genetic information, status as a U.S. veteran, service in the U.S. military, sexual orientation, gender identity, associational preferences, or any other classification that deprives the person of consideration as an individual. The university also affirms its commitment to providing equal opportunities and equal access to university facilities. For additional information on nondiscrimination policies, contact the Director, Office of Institutional Equity, the University of Iowa, 202 Jessup Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242-1316, 319-335-0705, oie-ui@uiowa.edu. Students may share their pronouns and chosen/preferred names in MyUI, which is accessible to instructors and advisors. Sexual Harassment/Sexual Misconduct and Supportive Measures: The University of Iowa prohibits all forms of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and related retaliation. The Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct governs actions by students, faculty, staff and visitors. Incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct can be reported to the Title IX and Gender Equity Office or to the Department of Public Safety. Students impacted by sexual harassment or sexual misconduct may be eligible for academic supportive measures and can learn more by contacting the Title IX and Gender Equity Office. Information about confidential resources can be found here. Watch the video for an explanation of these resources. Mental Health: Students are encouraged to be mindful of their mental health and seek help as a preventive measure or if feeling overwhelmed and/or struggling to meet course expectations. Students are encouraged to talk to their instructor for assistance with specific class-related concerns. For additional support and counseling, students are encouraged to contact University Counseling Service (UCS). Information about UCS, including resources and how to schedule an appointment, can be found at counseling.uiowa.edu. Find out more about UI mental health services at: mentalhealth.uiowa.edu. Basic Needs and Support for Students: It can be difficult to maintain focus and be present if you are experiencing challenges with meeting basic needs or navigating personal crisis situations. The Office of the Dean of Students can help. Contact us for one-on-one support, identifying options, and to locate and access basic needs resources (such as food, rent, childcare, etc.). Student Care and Assistance, 132 IMU, dos-assistance@uiowa.edu, 319-335-1162. Basic Needs Info: Food Pantry at Iowa, Clothing Closet, Basic Needs and Support Resource Sharing of Class Recordings: Students may be enrolled in a class where some sessions will be recorded or live-streamed. Such recordings/streaming will only be available to students registered for the class. These recordings are the intellectual property of the faculty and they may not be shared or reproduced without the explicit, written consent of the faculty member. Further, students may not share these sessions with those not in the class or upload them to any other online environment. Doing so would be a breach of the Code of Student Conduct, and, in some cases, a violation of state and federal law, including the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This course is provided by the College of Education and cross-listed with the Statistics Department. Policies on matters such as course requirements, grading, and sanctions for academic dishonesty are governed by the College of Education.

The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous attributes. One of those attributes will be the outcome or attribute of interest whereas the other will used as a predictor. The outcome or attribute of interest is sometimes referred to as the dependent variable and the predictor is sometimes referred to as the independent variable. One way to think about this is that the dependent variable depends or is a function of the other attributes of interest. In linear regression terms, it could also be said that the independent variable explains variation in the dependent variable (more on this later).\nOf note, variable is a typical word used in statistics, I’ve come to like the word attribute instead of variable. I will tend to use attribute, as in, a data attribute, but these are roughly interchangeable in my terminology.\nWe may write this general model as:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere \\(Y\\) is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating. More on this later too.\nSpecific example The data used for this section of the course is from the 2019 WNBA season. These data are part of the bayesrules package/book. The data contain 146 rows, one for each WNBA player sampled, and 32 attributes for that player.

That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season.\nOne first step in an analysis would be to explore each distribution independently first. I’m going to leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.\nThe next step would be to explore the bivariate figure of these two attributes. As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates. This can be done in R with the following code.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) Questions to consider What can be noticed about the relationship between these two attributes? Does there appear to be a relationship between the two? Is this relationship perfect?    Adding a smoother line Adding a smoother line to the figure can help to guide how strong the relationship may be. In general, there are two types of smoothers that we will consider in this course. One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI’m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n\\[ Avg\\_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes\\_Played + \\epsilon \\]\nOne way to read this equation is that the number of minutes played for each player helps to understand variation or differences in the average points scored for that player. Or, average points is modeled or explained by minutes played.\nFor the R formula, instead of an $ = $, you could insert a ~.\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg) ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.13562456 0.01014207  Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n\\[ \\hat{avg\\_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min\\_played \\]\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0 ## [1] 1.1356 1.1356 + .0101 * 1 ## [1] 1.1457 1.1356 + .0101 * 100 ## [1] 2.1456 1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$avg_points) ## [1] 1.189732 1.1356 + .0101 * 5000 ## [1] 51.6356 1.1356 + .0101 * -50 ## [1] 0.6306 Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept (\\(\\beta_{0}\\)), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, (\\(\\beta_{1}\\)), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn’t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\]\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course. More specifically, the variance in the outcome can be partioned or split into two components, those that the independent attribute helped to explain vs those that it can not explain. The part that can be explained is sometimes referred to as the sum of squares regression (SSR), the portion that is unexplained is referred to as the sum of squares error (SSE). This could be written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 + \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 \\]\nLet’s try to visualize what this means.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + mean(avg_points) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FF7F7F\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#65a765\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(mean(avg_points) + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FFD580\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)   Another related measure of error Another way to get a measure of how well the model is performing, would be a statistic called R-squared.

To use the function, you can replace “outcome” with an attribute name from the data above and “predictor” with another attribute above.\nWhat happens when you flip the outcome / predictor outcomes when computing the correlation? Does the correlation change? Why or why not? Given the correlation computed, how is it interpreted? Given the correlation computed, what information would this tell us when we try estimate the regression coefficients below?  cor(outcome ~ predictor, data = penguins, use = \u0026#39;complete.obs\u0026#39;) |\u0026gt; round(3)  Visualize bivariate distribution The following code creates a scatter plot showing the bivariate association between the two attributes entered. Example code is shown below as an example. You can replace the “outcome” and “predictor” with the two continuous attributes that you are interested in exploring. These need to be entered in quotations, either single or double are fine. You can also add a regression line or smoother line by specifying those arguments as either TRUE (ie., Yes) or FALSE (ie., No).\nDoes the association between the two attributes appear to be linear? What happens to the association if you flip the predictor / outcome attributes? How would you summarize the association in a few sentences?  visualize_relationship(outcome = \u0026#39;bill_length_mm\u0026#39;, predictor = \u0026#39;flipper_length_mm\u0026#39;, data = penguins, add_regression_line = TRUE, add_smoother_line = FALSE) ## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. ## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was ## generated. ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`). ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).  Linear Regression Fitting Similar to the bivariate scatterplot, the following function was created to fit a linear regression and extract some information about the model. The output should include the Intercept, Slope, R-square, and sigma estimates. You can specify the outcome and predictor by replacing those as you did in the bivariate scatterplot above to reflect the attributes you are interested in exploring.\nHow are the 4 estimates interpreted, particularly in the context of the problem? What happens to the 4 estimates if you flip the outcome and predictor attributes?  Which one should truly be the outcome and what should guide this?   model_fit(outcome = \u0026#39;bill_length_mm\u0026#39;, predictor = \u0026#39;flipper_length_mm\u0026#39;, data = penguins) ## Intercept Slope Rsquare sigma ## 1 -7.264868 0.2547682 0.430574 4.125874  ","date":1693267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693267200,"objectID":"730e6344c2a80c627178c5d190900d5b","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/02a-in-class-activity/","publishdate":"2023-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/02a-in-class-activity/","section":"lectures","summary":"In Class Activity - August 29, 2023 This activity is meant to give you some exploration of topics within class.

This can be helpful when 0 is not a practically useful characteristic of the attribute or for more specific tests of certain elements of the X attribute.\nMean Centering Mean centering is where the mean of the attribute is subtracted from each value. This is a linear transformation where each data point is subtracted by a constant, the mean. This means that the distance between points do not change.\nairquality \u0026lt;- airquality %\u0026gt;% mutate(avg_wind_mc = avg_wind - mean(avg_wind), avg_wind_maxc = avg_wind - max(avg_wind), avg_wind_10 = avg_wind - 10) gf_point(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_mc, data = airquality, size = 4, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Average daily wind speed (in knots)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Daily Air Quality\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;, linetype = 2) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; air_lm_mc \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_mc, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_mc) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_mc ## 38.788011 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_mc)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_mc)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479 air_lm_maxc \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_maxc, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_maxc) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_maxc ## 5.968391 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_maxc)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_maxc)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479 air_lm_10 \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_10, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_10) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_10 ## 26.104968 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_10)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_10)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479   Standardized Regression Another type of regression that can be done is one in which the attributes are standardized prior to estimating the linear regression.

I will show two ways, one is general, the other is specific to this simple case with a single predictor/covariate attribute. In general, linear regression (or more generally the general linear model) uses least square estimation. This means that the the parameters in the model minimize the squared distance between the observed and predicted values. That is, least squares estimates minimize this criterion:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\]\nSpecific example Calculus can be used to show that these two equations can be solved simultanuously to get estimates for \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) that minimize the criterion above. These formulas are:\n\\[ b_{1} = \\frac{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})(Y - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})^2} \\] \\[ b_{0} = \\bar{Y} - b_{1}\\bar{X} \\]\nLet’s use R to get these quantities.\nb1 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind)) * (daily_aqi - mean(daily_aqi))) / sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind))^2) ) b0 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, mean(daily_aqi) - b1 * mean(avg_wind) ) b0 ## [1] 48.22295 b1 ## [1] -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  General Approach When there are more than one predictor, the number of equations gets a bit unyieldy, therefore, there is a general analytic approach that works for any set of predictor attributes. The general approach uses matrix algebra (anyone take linear algebra?), to achieve their estimates. This general form is:\n\\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`} \\mathbf{Y} \\right). \\] Where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector of estimated regression coefficients, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of covariate/predictor attributes (called the design matrix), and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is a vector of the outcome attribute.\nBelow, I show what these would look like for the air quality example that has been used and solve for the regression coefficients.\nX \u0026lt;- model.matrix(air_lm) head(X) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 1 1 2.941667 ## 2 1 2.445833 ## 3 1 1.995833 ## 4 1 3.445833 ## 5 1 1.116667 ## 6 1 6.091667 Y \u0026lt;- as.matrix(airquality$daily_aqi) head(Y) ## [,1] ## [1,] 57 ## [2,] 54 ## [3,] 69 ## [4,] 56 ## [5,] 54 ## [6,] 22 X_X \u0026lt;- solve(t(X) %*% X) X_X ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## (Intercept) 0.0008152474 -1.424894e-04 ## avg_wind -0.0001424894 3.340328e-05 X_Y \u0026lt;- t(X) %*% Y X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 186997 ## avg_wind 731464 X_X %*% X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 48.222946 ## avg_wind -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798    ","date":1693267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693267200,"objectID":"4f3ecf68d62b085e025f260de84450f2","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/03-regression-estimates/","publishdate":"2023-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/03-regression-estimates/","section":"lectures","summary":"Understanding Regression Parameters This section of notes aims to dig a bit more into what the simple linear regression (ie., regression with a single continuous covariate/attribute) parameter estimates mean.","tags":null,"title":"Regression Estimation","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The following activity is aimed to give you some practice with exploring data on your own using statistical software.
