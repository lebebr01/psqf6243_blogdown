They must be tortured to confess. \u0026ndash; Jeff Hooper, Bell Labs\nCourse Description The course aims to get students familiar with statistical reasoning, fitting and interpreting statistical models, and using data to make decisions. Students are assumed to have some background in statistical concepts and have a basic understanding of common descriptive statistics and bivariate association (e.g., Pearson correlation).\nThis course will focus on using statistical methods to answer research questions and make decisions from data. General linear models (i.e., regression) will serve as the fundamental building block that students will be exposed to answer questions about associations of quantitative outcomes with quantitative and categorical predictors. Statistical estimation, model building, and inference using statistical software will serve as primary topics which students will gain a stronger understanding by the end of the course.\nCourse Objectives The course requirements and class materials are aimed to help students achieve the following course objectives:\n become more fluent in statistical terminology, use statistical software, turn research questions into actionable statistical methods, engage with statistical theory, connect model equations with statistical code, summarize uncertainty and variation in estimation.  Textbook  Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd edition), by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani: https://www.statlearning.com/ Optional/Supplemental Text:  Statistical Reasoning through Computation and R, by LeBeau and Zieffler: https://lebebr01.github.io/stat_thinking/ Introduction to Modern Statistics, by Cetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. Found online here: https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/ Applied Regression: An Introduction, by Lewis-Beck and Lewis-Beck. Online access via library: https://dx-doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.4135/9781483396774.n1.   Class notes and Jupyter Notebooks used in class will also be shared through the course website.  Course Requirements   Online Quizzes: There will be a total of 8 to 10 online quizzes taken through ICON. Each quiz will be available for about 5 days and are open note/book, but should be completed independently and will need to be completed in a single occasion. The dates will be discussed in class and announcements will be sent by email to communicate when quizzes open and close. Quizzes will generally be due on Sunday evenings.\n  Exams: There will also be two exams taken on ICON. One exam will be around midterm time and the second will be during final exam week. The online exams will be about 20 questions and will be open book/note. The exams will be available for at least 5 days, just like the quizzes and should be completed independently.\n  Assignments: 4 total assignments spread throughout the course will be used to improve student understanding and give students practice to work with data. These assignments can be completed within small groups of no more than 3 students. If completed as a group, all students will receive the same score and only one assignment with everyone\u0026rsquo;s name on it needs to be turned in.\n  Activities: 4 to 6 activities will be posted across the semester. These are pass/fail activities, therefore, completing these will give you 10% of the final course grade. Completion of these is posting answers to the questions that show you interacted and engaged in the activity. Answers that are not on topic or missing will not count as \u0026ldquo;passing\u0026rdquo; that given activity. These activities are meant to be formative assessments to give you time to practice interpreting statistics. Similar to the assignments, you may work in groups of up to 3 to complete these activities, in which you would all receive the same pass/fail grade for the activity.\n  Absences: Absences happen. Therefore, I ask you to be as transparent as possible with me. I promise to be compassionate and understanding. If at any point in the semester you are having difficulties, please reach out to me and I will do my best to be accommodating and provide support, which could include an extension on course deadlines as necessary.\n  Grading: Final grades will be based on the following weighting scheme:\n 8 to 10 quizzes, equally weighted, 30% of total grade 2 exams, equally weighted, 30% of total grade 4 assignments, equally weighted, 30% of total grade 4 to 6 activities, equally weighted, 10% of total grade    Percentage Breakdown: Guidelines are given below, plus and minus grades will be given as well. Changes may occur to the grade percentage breakdown below, but the percentages will not get higher. For example, the lower percentage to get a B, could drop to 75%, but will never be higher than 80%. I will do my best to communicate any shifts to these grade ranges as the semester progresses.\n A 90% and above B 80% up to 90% C 70% up to 80% D Below 70%    Course and University Policies  Announcements and Communication: Any announcements regarding the course will be communicated via e-mail so please check it daily. Course materials will be posted to ICON. Go to icon.uiowa.edu for access to the ICON site. Adaptations and Modifications: Please inform me during the first two weeks if you require special adaptations or modifications to any assignment or due dates because of special circumstances such as learning disabilities, religious observances, or other appropriate needs. Contesting a Grade: To contest a grade, please send me an e-mail detailing your reason within 48 hours of receiving the grade. This allows both of us time to think, reflect, and discuss the matter without taking class time from other students. When contesting a grade, provide a copy of the graded assignment. Academic Misconduct: Plagiarism and cheating may result in grade reduction and/or serious penalties. Unless you are otherwise instructed, your work should be entirely your own. Please take care in writing your final project. You should always be writing in your own words, citing others' ideas, and quoting text as appropriate. This link provides the College of Education policy on student academic misconduct (plagiarism and cheating) https://education.uiowa.edu/coe-policies/student-academic-misconduct. Free Speech and Expression: The University of Iowa supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principles of academic and artistic freedom. We are committed to open inquiry, vigorous debate, and creative expression inside and outside of the classroom. Visit the Free Speech at Iowa website for more information on the university’s policies on free speech and academic freedom. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University is committed to providing an educational experience that is accessible to all students. If a student has a diagnosed disability or other disabling condition that may impact the student’s ability to complete the course requirements as stated in the syllabus, the student may seek accommodations through Student Disability Services (SDS). SDS is responsible for making Letters of Accommodation (LOA) available to the student. The student must provide a LOA to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, but requests not made at least two weeks prior to the scheduled activity for which an accommodation is sought may not be accommodated. The LOA will specify what reasonable course accommodations the student is eligible for and those the instructor should provide. Additional information can be found on the SDS website. Absences for Religious Holy Days: The University is prepared to make reasonable accommodations for students whose religious holy days coincide with their classroom assignments, test schedules, and classroom attendance expectations. Students must notify their instructors in writing of any such Religious Holy Day conflicts or absences within the first few days of the semester or session, and no later than the third week of the semester. If the conflict or absence will occur within the first three weeks of the semester, the student should notify the instructor as soon as possible. See Operations Manual 8.2 Absences for Religious Holy Days for additional information. Classroom Expectations: Students are expected to comply with University policies regarding appropriate classroom behavior as outlined in the Code of Student Life. While students have the right to express themselves and participate freely in class, it is expected that students will behave with the same level of courtesy and respect in the virtual class setting (whether asynchronous or synchronous) as they would in an in-person classroom. Failure to follow behavior expectations as outlined in the Code of Student Life may be addressed by the instructor and may also result in discipline under the Code of Student Life policies governing E.5 Disruptive Behavior or E.6 Failure to Comply with University Directive. Non-Discrimination Statement: The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, pregnancy, disability, genetic information, status as a U.S. veteran, service in the U.S. military, sexual orientation, gender identity, associational preferences, or any other classification that deprives a person of consideration as an individual (https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/community-policies/human-rights). For more information, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (https://diversity.uiowa.edu/eod, or 319-335-0705, or diversity@uiowa.edu). Students may share their pronouns and chosen/preferred names in MyUI, which is accessible to instructors and advisors. Sexual Harassment/Sexual Misconduct and Supportive Measures: The University of Iowa prohibits all forms of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and related retaliation. The Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct governs actions by students, faculty, staff and visitors. Incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct can be reported to the Title IX and Gender Equity Office or to the Department of Public Safety. Students impacted by sexual harassment or sexual misconduct may be eligible for academic supportive measures and can learn more by contacting the Title IX and Gender Equity Office. Information about confidential resources can be found here. Watch the video for an explanation of these resources. Mental Health: Students are encouraged to be mindful of their mental health and seek help as a preventive measure or if feeling overwhelmed and/or struggling to meet course expectations. Students are encouraged to talk to their instructor for assistance with specific class-related concerns. For additional support and counseling, students are encouraged to contact University Counseling Service (UCS).

The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous predictors or attributes.

The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later.

That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season.\nOne first step in an analysis would be to explore each distribution independently first. I’m going to leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.\nThe next step would be to explore the bivariate figure of these two attributes. As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates. This can be done in R with the following code.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) cor(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) ## [1] 0.8476624 Questions to consider What can be noticed about the relationship between these two attributes? Does there appear to be a relationship between the two? Is this relationship perfect?    Adding a smoother line Adding a smoother line to the figure can help to guide how strong the relationship may be. In general, there are two types of smoothers that we will consider in this course. One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI’m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n\\[ Avg\\_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes\\_Played + \\epsilon \\]\nFor the R formula, instead of an \\(=\\), you could insert a \\(~\\).\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg) ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.13562456 0.01014207 \\[ Avg\\_points = 1.1356 + .0101 Minutes + \\epsilon \\]\n Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n\\[ \\hat{avg\\_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min\\_played \\]\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0 ## [1] 1.1356 1.1356 + .0101 * 1 ## [1] 1.1457 1.1356 + .0101 * 100 ## [1] 2.1456 1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$total_minutes) ## [1] 5.342042 1.1356 + .0101 * 5000 ## [1] 51.6356 1.1356 + .0101 * -50 ## [1] 0.6306 Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept (\\(\\beta_{0}\\)), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, (\\(\\beta_{1}\\)), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn’t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\]\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course.

The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous predictors or attributes. We may write this general model as:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere \\(Y\\) is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating. More on this later too.\nSpecific example The data used for this section of the course is from the 2019 WNBA season. These data are part of the bayesrules package/book.

That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season.\nOne first step in an analysis would be to explore each distribution independently first. I’m going to leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.\nThe next step would be to explore the bivariate figure of these two attributes. As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates. This can be done in R with the following code.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) Questions to consider What can be noticed about the relationship between these two attributes? Does there appear to be a relationship between the two? Is this relationship perfect?    Adding a smoother line Adding a smoother line to the figure can help to guide how strong the relationship may be. In general, there are two types of smoothers that we will consider in this course. One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI’m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n\\[ Avg\\_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes\\_Played + \\epsilon \\]\nFor the R formula, instead of an \\(=\\), you could insert a \\(~\\).\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg) ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.13562456 0.01014207  Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n\\[ \\hat{avg\\_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min\\_played \\]\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0 ## [1] 1.1356 1.1356 + .0101 * 1 ## [1] 1.1457 1.1356 + .0101 * 100 ## [1] 2.1456 1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$total_minutes) ## [1] 5.342042 1.1356 + .0101 * 5000 ## [1] 51.6356 1.1356 + .0101 * -50 ## [1] 0.6306 mean(basketball$total_minutes) ## [1] 416.4795 Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept (\\(\\beta_{0}\\)), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, (\\(\\beta_{1}\\)), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn’t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\]\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course. More specifically, the variance in the outcome can be partioned or split into two components, those that the independent attribute helped to explain vs those that it can not explain. The part that can be explained is sometimes referred to as the sum of squares regression (SSR), the portion that is unexplained is referred to as the sum of squares error (SSE). This could be written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 + \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - (\\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1}X))^2 \\]\n\\[ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 }{n - 2} \\]\nLet’s try to visualize what this means.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + mean(avg_points) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FF7F7F\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#65a765\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(mean(avg_points) + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FFD580\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) summary(wnba_reg)$sigma ## [1] 1.979045   Another related measure of error Another way to get a measure of how well the model is performing, would be a statistic called R-squared.

This can be helpful when 0 is not a practically useful characteristic of the attribute or for more specific tests of certain elements of the X attribute.\nMean Centering Mean centering is where the mean of the attribute is subtracted from each value. This is a linear transformation where each data point is subtracted by a constant, the mean. This means that the distance between points do not change.\nairquality \u0026lt;- airquality %\u0026gt;% mutate(avg_wind_mc = avg_wind - mean(avg_wind), avg_wind_maxc = avg_wind - max(avg_wind), avg_wind_10 = avg_wind - 10) gf_point(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_mc, data = airquality, size = 4, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Average daily wind speed (in knots)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Daily Air Quality\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;, linetype = 2) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; air_lm_mc \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_mc, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_mc) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_mc ## 38.788011 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_mc)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_mc)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479 air_lm_maxc \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_maxc, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_maxc) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_maxc ## 5.968391 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_maxc)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_maxc)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479 air_lm_10 \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_10, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_10) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_10 ## 26.104968 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_10)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_10)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479   Standardized Regression Another type of regression that can be done is one in which the attributes are standardized prior to estimating the linear regression.

I will show two ways, one is general, the other is specific to this simple case with a single predictor/covariate attribute. In general, linear regression (or more generally the general linear model) uses least square estimation. This means that the the parameters in the model minimize the squared distance between the observed and predicted values. That is, least squares estimates minimize this criterion:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\]\nSpecific example Calculus can be used to show that these two equations can be solved simultanuously to get estimates for \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) that minimize the criterion above. These formulas are:\n\\[ b_{1} = \\frac{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})(Y - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})^2} \\] \\[ b_{0} = \\bar{Y} - b_{1}\\bar{X} \\]\nLet’s use R to get these quantities.\nb1 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind)) * (daily_aqi - mean(daily_aqi))) / sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind))^2) ) b0 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, mean(daily_aqi) - b1 * mean(avg_wind) ) b0 ## [1] 48.22295 b1 ## [1] -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  General Approach When there are more than one predictor, the number of equations gets a bit unyieldy, therefore, there is a general analytic approach that works for any set of predictor attributes. The general approach uses matrix algebra (anyone take linear algebra?), to achieve their estimates. This general form is:\n\\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`} \\mathbf{Y} \\right). \\] Where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector of estimated regression coefficients, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of covariate/predictor attributes (called the design matrix), and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is a vector of the outcome attribute.\nBelow, I show what these would look like for the air quality example that has been used and solve for the regression coefficients.\nX \u0026lt;- model.matrix(air_lm) head(X) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 1 1 2.941667 ## 2 1 2.445833 ## 3 1 1.995833 ## 4 1 3.445833 ## 5 1 1.116667 ## 6 1 6.091667 Y \u0026lt;- as.matrix(airquality$daily_aqi) head(Y) ## [,1] ## [1,] 57 ## [2,] 54 ## [3,] 69 ## [4,] 56 ## [5,] 54 ## [6,] 22 X_X \u0026lt;- solve(t(X) %*% X) X_X ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## (Intercept) 0.0008152474 -1.424894e-04 ## avg_wind -0.0001424894 3.340328e-05 X_Y \u0026lt;- t(X) %*% Y X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 186997 ## avg_wind 731464 X_X %*% X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 48.222946 ## avg_wind -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798    ","date":1630540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630540800,"objectID":"c4fb6591bac1c6b88503b9ea8067003b","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/regression-estimates/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/regression-estimates/","section":"lectures","summary":"Linear Regression Estimates","tags":null,"title":"Linear Regression Estimates","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Understanding Regression Parameters This section of notes aims to dig a bit more into what the simple linear regression (ie., regression with a single continuous covariate) parameters mean.

This can be helpful when 0 is not a practically useful characteristic of the attribute or for more specific tests of certain elements of the X attribute.\nMean Centering Mean centering is where the mean of the attribute is subtracted from each value. This is a linear transformation where each data point is subtracted by a constant, the mean.

I will show two ways, one is general, the other is specific to this simple case with a single predictor/covariate attribute. In general, linear regression (or more generally the general linear model) uses least square estimation. This means that the the parameters in the model minimize the squared distance between the observed and predicted values. That is, least squares estimates minimize this criterion:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\]\nSpecific example Calculus can be used to show that these two equations can be solved simultanuously to get estimates for \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) that minimize the criterion above. These formulas are:\n\\[ b_{1} = \\frac{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})(Y - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})^2} \\]\n\\[ b_{0} = \\bar{Y} - b_{1}\\bar{X} \\]\nLet’s use R to get these quantities.\nb1 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind)) * (daily_aqi - mean(daily_aqi))) / sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind))^2) ) b0 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, mean(daily_aqi) - b1 * mean(avg_wind) ) b0 ## [1] 48.22295 b1 ## [1] -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  General Approach When there are more than one predictor, the number of equations gets a bit unyieldy, therefore, there is a general analytic approach that works for any set of predictor attributes. The general approach uses matrix algebra (anyone take linear algebra?), to achieve their estimates. This general form is:\n\\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`} \\mathbf{Y} \\right). \\] Where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector of estimated regression coefficients, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of covariate/predictor attributes (called the design matrix), and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is a vector of the outcome attribute.\nBelow, I show what these would look like for the air quality example that has been used and solve for the regression coefficients.\nX \u0026lt;- model.matrix(air_lm) head(X) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 1 1 2.941667 ## 2 1 2.445833 ## 3 1 1.995833 ## 4 1 3.445833 ## 5 1 1.116667 ## 6 1 6.091667 Y \u0026lt;- as.matrix(airquality$daily_aqi) head(Y) ## [,1] ## [1,] 57 ## [2,] 54 ## [3,] 69 ## [4,] 56 ## [5,] 54 ## [6,] 22 X_X \u0026lt;- solve(t(X) %*% X) X_X ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## (Intercept) 0.0008152474 -1.424894e-04 ## avg_wind -0.0001424894 3.340328e-05 X_Y \u0026lt;- t(X) %*% Y X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 186997 ## avg_wind 731464 X_X %*% X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 48.222946 ## avg_wind -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798    ","date":1631232000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631232000,"objectID":"f7780f42c5b65f9ac8d94f48ac992b93","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/regression-estimates-class/","publishdate":"2021-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/regression-estimates-class/","section":"lectures","summary":"Linear Regression Estimates - class","tags":null,"title":"Linear Regression Estimates - class","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Digging deeper into linear regression.

The reason inference is useful is based on the idea that for most problems the sample is used to approximate the population. Therefore, a subset of the population (the sample) is used to estimate the population parameters that are of most interest. As such, our estimates come with error and this uncertainty we can quantify when making inference about the parameter estimates.\nIn this course, I plan to show you two ways to perform this inference. One of those frameworks will be the classical approach which uses classical statistical theory to estimate the amount of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The second approach will use the bootstrap as a way to computationally estimate the uncertainty. The benefit of the bootstrap is that it comes with fewer assumptions than the classical approach. We will build up to these arguments.\nClassical Inferential Framework The classical inferential framework, sometimes referred to as the null hypothesis significance test (NHST) has been around for more than 100 years. This framework builds off of the idea of a null hypothesis.\nA null hypothesis is typically thought as a hypothesis that assumes there is no relationship or a null effect. Framing this in the regression concept that we have been working with, we could define the following null hypotheses.\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{0} = 0.\\ The\\ population\\ yintercept\\ equals\\ 0. \\]\nor\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = 0.\\ The\\ population\\ slope\\ equals\\ 0. \\]\nIn the following two null hypotheses, represented with \\(H_{0}\\), the population parameters are being assumed to be 0 in the population. This is one definition of a null effect, but is not the only null effect we can define (more on this later). The value defined as a null effect is important as it centers the sampling distribution used for evaluating where the sample estimate falls in that distribution.\nAnother hypothesis is typically defined with the null hypothesis, called the alternative hypothesis. This hypothesis states that there is an effect. Within the linear regression framework, we could write the alternative hypotheses as:\n\\[ H_{A}: \\beta_{0} \\neq 0.\\ The\\ population\\ yintercept\\ is\\ not\\ equal\\ to\\ 0. \\]\nor\n\\[ H_{A}: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0.\\ The\\ population\\ slope\\ is\\ not\\ equal\\ to\\ 0. \\]\nIn the following two alternative hypotheses, represented with \\(H_{A}\\), the population parameters are assumed to be not equal to 0. These can also be one-sided, more on this with an example later.\nEstimating uncertainty in parameter estimates The standard error is used to estimate uncertainty or error in the parameter estimates due to having a sample from the population. More specifically, this means that the entire population is not used to estimate the parameter, therefore the estimate we have is very likely not equal exactly to the parameter. Instead, there is some sort of sampling error involved that we want to quantify. If the sample was collected well, ideally randomly, then the estimate should be unbiased. Unbiased here doesn’t mean that the estimate equals the population parameter, rather, that through repeated sampling, the average of our sample estimates would equal the population parameter.\nAs mentioned, standard errors are used to quantify this uncertainty. In the linear regression case we have explored so far, there are mathematical formula for the standard errors. These are shown below.\n\\[ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{0} \\right)^2 = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{X}^2}{\\sum \\left( X - \\bar{X} \\right)^2} \\right)} \\]\nand\n\\[ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{1} \\right)^2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{\\sum \\left( X - \\bar{X} \\right)^2}} \\]\nIn the equation above, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), is equal to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{error}}{n - 2}}\\), and \\(n\\) is the sample size (ie, number of rows of data in the model).\nMatrix Representation It is also possible, and more easily extendable, to write the standard error computations or the variance of the estimated parameters in matrix representation. This framework extends beyond the single predictor case (ie. one \\(X\\)), therefore is more readily used in practice.\n\\[ \\hat{var}\\left({\\hat{\\beta}}\\right) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\]\nIn the equation above, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), is equal to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{error}}{n - 2}}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the design matrix from the regression analysis. Finally, to get the standard errors back, you take the square root of the diagonal elements.\n$$ SE( ) =   Data The data for this section of notes will explore data from the Environmental Protection Agency on Air Quality collected for the state of Iowa in 2021.

There are two related pieces that can be computed now, a confidence interval and/or the test-statistic and p-value. Let’s go through both.\nFirst, a confidence interval can be computed. Confidence intervals take the following general form:\n\\[ \\hat{\\beta} \\pm C * SE \\]\nWhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the parameter estimate, \\(C\\) is the confidence level, and \\(SE\\) is the standard error. The parameter estimates and standard errors are what we have already established, the \\(C\\) is the confidence level. This indicates the percentage of times, over the long run/repeated sampling, that the interval will capture the population parameter. Historically, this value is often specified as 95%, but any value is theoretically possible.\nThe \\(C\\) value represents a quantile from a mathematical distribution that separates the middle percetage desired (ie, 95%) from the rest of the distribution. The mathematical distribution is most often the t-distribution, but the difference between a t-distribution and normal distribution are modest once the sample size is greater than 30 or so.\nThe figure below tries to highlight the \\(C\\) value.\nt_30 \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(-5, 5, .01), density = dt(seq(-5, 5, .01), df = 30)) gf_line(density ~ value, data = t_30) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.025, df = 30), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.975, df = 30), linetype = 2) coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798 summary(air_lm)$coefficients[,2] ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 0.5155100 0.1043487 abs(qt(.025, df = nrow(airquality) -2)) ## [1] 1.960456 48.2 + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * .5155 ## [1] 47.18962 49.21038 -2.211 + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * .1043 ## [1] -2.415428 -2.006572  Inference with test statistics It is also possible to do inference with a test statistic and computation of a p-value. Inference in this framework can be summarized into the following steps:\nGenerate hypotheses, ie null and alternative hypotheses. Establish an \\(\\alpha\\) value Estimate parameters Compute test statistic Generate p-value  An \\(\\alpha\\) value is the level of significance and represents the probability of obtaining the results due to chance. This is a value that the researcher can select. For a 5% \\(\\alpha\\) value, this is what was used above to compute the confidence intervals.\nThe test statistic is computed as follows:\n\\[ test\\ stat = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta} - hypothesized\\ value}{SE(\\hat{\\beta})} \\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the estimated parameter, \\(SE(\\hat{\\beta})\\) is the standard error of the parameter estimate, and the \\(hypothesized\\ value\\) is the hypothesized value from the null hypothesis. This is often 0, but does not need to be zero.\nLet’s assume the following null/alternative hypotheses:\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = 0 \\\\ H_{A}: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0 \\]\nLet’s use R to compute this test statistic.\nt = (-2.211 - 0) / .1043 t ## [1] -21.19847 pt(-21.198, df = nrow(airquality) -2, lower.tail = TRUE) ## [1] 1.003866e-95 t_dist \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(-25, 25, .05), density = dt(seq(-25, 25, .05), df = (nrow(airquality) - 2))) gf_line(density ~ value, data = t_dist) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.025, df = (nrow(airquality) - 2)), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.975, df = (nrow(airquality) - 2)), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ -21.198, color = \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ 21.198, color = \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) summary(air_lm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = daily_aqi ~ avg_wind, data = airquality) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -41.71 -14.38 -0.73 12.43 86.84 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

A short description for each attribute is as follows.\n   Attribute Name Description     id Unique identifier for each row   hour The hour of the ride   day The day of the ride   month The month of the ride, either 11 = November or 12 = December   price The total price of the ride, in $   temperature The outside temperature at the time of the ride, in Fahrenheit   distance Total distance of the ride, in miles   surge_multiplier The surge multiplier for the cost of rides   humidity The humidity at the time of the ride    Guiding Question Does the distance of the ride explain variation in the price of the ride?\nQuestions   Explore the distribution of the price of the rides descriptively. In a few sentences, summarize key elements of the distribution, for instance discussing elements related to shape, center, variation, and/or extreme values.\n  Explore the bivariate distribution of the price of ride and distance of rides. In a few sentences, summarize key elements of the relationship between price and distance. You may wish to include the following elements of the association, strength, direction, and/or form.\n  Does the association between price and distance of rides appear to be linear? Why or why not?\n  Fit a linear regression to answer the research question highlighted above. Interpret the intercept and slope of the linear regression. That is, what do these terms mean?\n  What are the r-squared and sigma estimates from the linear regression? Interpret these two values in the context of the problem. That is, what do these two terms mean in the context of the data and this problem?\n  Finally, in a couple sentences, provide a summary of the overall model. Does the model appear to be useful to predict the price of a ride with only the distance of the ride? Use statistics from the analysis steps above to support your answer.\n  ","date":1631577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631577600,"objectID":"1f0ddba60194db863d603a9e55d6d82d","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/assignments/activity/activity1/","publishdate":"2021-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/activity/activity1/","section":"assignments","summary":"The following activity is aimed to give you some practice with exploring data and running a linear regression on your own using statistical software.
