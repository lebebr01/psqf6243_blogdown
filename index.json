Students are assumed to have some background in statistical concepts and have a basic understanding of common descriptive statistics and bivariate association (e.g., Pearson correlation).\nThis course will focus on using statistical methods to answer research questions and make decisions from data. General linear models (i.e., regression) will serve as the fundamental building block that students will be exposed to answer questions about associations of quantitative outcomes with quantitative and categorical predictors. Statistical estimation, model building, and inference using statistical software will serve as primary topics which students will gain a stronger understanding by the end of the course.\nCourse Objectives The course requirements and class materials are aimed to help students achieve the following course objectives:\n become more fluent in statistical terminology, use statistical software, turn research questions into actionable statistical methods, engage with statistical theory, connect model equations with statistical code, summarize uncertainty and variation in estimation.  Textbook  Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd edition), by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani: https://www.statlearning.com/ Supplemental Text:  Statistical Reasoning through Computation and R, by LeBeau and Zieffler: https://lebebr01.github.io/stat_thinking/ Introduction to Modern Statistics, by Cetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. Found online here: https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/ Applied Regression: An Introduction, by Lewis-Beck and Lewis-Beck. Online access via library: https://dx-doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.4135/9781483396774.n1.   Class notes and Jupyter Notebooks used in class will also be shared through the course website.  Course Requirements   Online Quizzes: There will be a total of 10 online quizzes taken through ICON. Each quiz will be available for 5 to 7 days and are open note/book, but should be completed independently and will need to be completed in a single occasion. Expect each quiz to be about 10 questions. The dates will be discussed in class and announcements will be sent by email to communicate when quizzes open and close. Quizzes will account for 40% of the course grade.\n  Assignments: 4 assignments spread throughout the course will be used to improve student understanding and give students practice to work with data. These assignments can be completed within small groups of no more than 3 students. If completed as a group, all students will receive the same score and only one assignment with everyone\u0026rsquo;s name on it needs to be turned in. Assignments will account for 40% of the course grade.\n  Activities: Approximately 6 activities will be posted across the semester. These are complete/incomplete activities, therefore, completing these will give you 20% of the final course grade. Completion of these involve posting answers to the questions that show you interacted and engaged in the activity. Answers that are not on topic or missing will not count as \u0026ldquo;passing\u0026rdquo; for that activity. These activities are meant to be formative assessments to give you time to practice interpreting statistics. Similar to the assignments, you may work in groups of up to 3 to complete these activities, in which you would all receive the same pass/fail grade for the activity.\n  Absences: Absences happen. Therefore, I ask you to be as transparent as possible with me. I promise to be compassionate and understanding. If at any point in the semester you are having difficulties, please reach out to me and I will do my best to be accommodating and provide support, which could include an extension on course deadlines as necessary.\n  Grading: Final grades will be based on the following weighting scheme:\n 10 quizzes, equally weighted, 40% of total grade 4 assignments, equally weighted, 40% of total grade About 6 activities, equally weighted, 20% of total grade    Percentage Breakdown: Guidelines are given below, plus and minus grades will be given as well. Changes may occur to the grade percentage breakdown below, but the percentages will not get higher. For example, the lower percentage to get a B, could drop to 75%, but will never be higher than 80%. I will do my best to communicate any shifts to these grade ranges as the semester progresses.\n A 90% and above B 80% up to 90% C 70% up to 80% D Below 70%    Course and University Policies  Announcements and Communication: Any announcements regarding the course will be communicated via email so please check it daily.  Email Expectations: I want to be transparent regarding course email. Email is not meant to be an instantaneous exchange, rather, email is asynchronous. I typically will respond to an email within one business day. Note, I typically will not respond to email over the weekend or during evening hours, but there could be exceptions to this. If I do send an email during the evening or weekend, there is no expectation that you reply immediately as well. If a reply is warranted, reply on your own time. Please be advised that this applies to all elements of the semester, even around due dates. If you email a question the day an assignment is due, I may not be able to get back to you until the next day   Course Materials: Course materials will be posted to ICON or the course website. Go to icon.uiowa.edu for access to the ICON site and the primary course website for PSQF 6243. Adaptations and Modifications: Please inform me during the first two weeks if you require special adaptations or modifications to any assignment or due dates because of special circumstances such as learning disabilities, religious observances, or other appropriate needs. Contesting a Grade: To contest a grade, please send me an email detailing your reason within 48 hours of receiving the grade. This allows both of us time to think, reflect, and discuss the matter without taking class time from other students. When contesting a grade, provide a copy of the graded assignment. Academic Misconduct: Plagiarism and cheating may result in grade reduction and/or serious penalties. Unless you are otherwise instructed, your work should be entirely your own. Please take care in writing your final project. You should always be writing in your own words, citing others' ideas, and quoting text as appropriate. This link provides the College of Education policy on student academic misconduct. Student Complaint Procedures: The College of Education policy on student complaints about faculty action Use of AI: Students are invited to use AI platforms to help prepare for assignments and projects (e.g., to help with brainstorming or to test your own knowledge about specific course topics). I also welcome you to use AI tools to help revise and edit your work (e.g., to help identify flaws in reasoning, spot confusing or underdeveloped paragraphs, or to simply fix citations). If you use AI tools to aid in writing or editing any written material you submit for the course, please make sure you cite the tool and indicate how you fact checked the material.  University Policies The following University of Iowa course policies are published by the Provost office.\nAt the University of Iowa, we strive for a classroom or laboratory climate that encourages learning while also protecting the freedoms and rights of our students and faculty.\nPlease review the following course policies, expectations, and resources. Visit the Dean of Students website for additional student policies and procedures.\n Free Speech and Expression: The University of Iowa supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principles of academic and artistic freedom. We are committed to open inquiry, vigorous debate, and creative expression inside and outside of the classroom. Visit the Free Speech at Iowa website for more information on the university’s policies on free speech and academic freedom. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University is committed to providing an educational experience that is accessible to all students. If a student has a diagnosed disability or other disabling condition that may impact the student’s ability to complete the course requirements as stated in the syllabus, the student may seek accommodations through Student Disability Services (SDS). SDS is responsible for making Letters of Accommodation (LOA) available to the student. The student must provide a LOA to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, but requests not made at least two weeks prior to the scheduled activity for which an accommodation is sought may not be accommodated. The LOA will specify what reasonable course accommodations the student is eligible for and those the instructor should provide. Additional information can be found on the SDS website. Absences from Class: University regulations require that students be allowed to make up examinations which have been missed due to illness, religious holy days, military service obligations, including service-related medical appointments, jury duty, or other unavoidable circumstances or other University-sponsored activities. Students should work with faculty regarding making up other missed work, such as assignments, quizzes, and classroom attendance. Absences for Religious Holy Days: The University is prepared to make reasonable accommodations for students whose religious holy days coincide with their classroom assignments, test schedules, and classroom attendance expectations. Students must notify their instructors in writing of any such Religious Holy Day conflicts or absences within the first few days of the semester or session, and no later than the third week of the semester. If the conflict or absence will occur within the first three weeks of the semester, the student should notify the instructor as soon as possible. See Operations Manual 8.2 Absences for Religious Holy Days for additional information. Absences for Military Service Obligations: Students absent from class or class-related requirements due to U.S. veteran or U.S. military service obligations (including military service–related medical appointments, military orders, and National Guard Service obligations) shall be excused without any grading adjustment or other penalty. Instructors shall make reasonable accommodations to allow students to make up, without penalty, tests and assignments they missed because of veteran or military service obligations. Reasonable accommodations may include making up missed work following the service obligation; completing work in advance; completing an equivalent assignment; or waiver of the assignment without penalty. In all instances, students bear the responsibility to communicate with their instructors about such veteran or military service obligations, to meet course expectations and requirements. Classroom Expectations: Students are expected to comply with University policies regarding appropriate classroom behavior as outlined in the Code of Student Life. While students have the right to express themselves and participate freely in class, it is expected that students will behave with the same level of courtesy and respect in the virtual class setting (whether asynchronous or synchronous) as they would in an in-person classroom. Failure to follow behavior expectations as outlined in the Code of Student Life may be addressed by the instructor and may also result in discipline under the Code of Student Life policies governing E.5 Disruptive Behavior or E.6 Failure to Comply with University Directive. Non-Discrimination Statement: The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination in employment, educational programs, and activities on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, pregnancy, disability, genetic information, status as a U.S. veteran, service in the U.S. military, sexual orientation, gender identity, associational preferences, or any other classification that deprives the person of consideration as an individual. The university also affirms its commitment to providing equal opportunities and equal access to university facilities. For additional information on nondiscrimination policies, contact the Director, Office of Institutional Equity, the University of Iowa, 202 Jessup Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242-1316, 319-335-0705, oie-ui@uiowa.edu. Students may share their pronouns and chosen/preferred names in MyUI, which is accessible to instructors and advisors. Sexual Harassment/Sexual Misconduct and Supportive Measures: The University of Iowa prohibits all forms of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and related retaliation. The Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct governs actions by students, faculty, staff and visitors. Incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct can be reported to the Title IX and Gender Equity Office or to the Department of Public Safety. Students impacted by sexual harassment or sexual misconduct may be eligible for academic supportive measures and can learn more by contacting the Title IX and Gender Equity Office. Information about confidential resources can be found here. Watch the video for an explanation of these resources. Mental Health: Students are encouraged to be mindful of their mental health and seek help as a preventive measure or if feeling overwhelmed and/or struggling to meet course expectations. Students are encouraged to talk to their instructor for assistance with specific class-related concerns. For additional support and counseling, students are encouraged to contact University Counseling Service (UCS). Information about UCS, including resources and how to schedule an appointment, can be found at counseling.uiowa.edu. Find out more about UI mental health services at: mentalhealth.uiowa.edu. Basic Needs and Support for Students: It can be difficult to maintain focus and be present if you are experiencing challenges with meeting basic needs or navigating personal crisis situations. The Office of the Dean of Students can help. Contact us for one-on-one support, identifying options, and to locate and access basic needs resources (such as food, rent, childcare, etc.). Student Care and Assistance, 132 IMU, dos-assistance@uiowa.edu, 319-335-1162. Basic Needs Info: Food Pantry at Iowa, Clothing Closet, Basic Needs and Support Resource Sharing of Class Recordings: Students may be enrolled in a class where some sessions will be recorded or live-streamed. Such recordings/streaming will only be available to students registered for the class. These recordings are the intellectual property of the faculty and they may not be shared or reproduced without the explicit, written consent of the faculty member. Further, students may not share these sessions with those not in the class or upload them to any other online environment. Doing so would be a breach of the Code of Student Conduct, and, in some cases, a violation of state and federal law, including the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This course is provided by the College of Education and cross-listed with the Statistics Department. Policies on matters such as course requirements, grading, and sanctions for academic dishonesty are governed by the College of Education.

The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous attributes. One of those attributes will be the outcome or attribute of interest whereas the other will used as a predictor. The outcome or attribute of interest is sometimes referred to as the dependent variable and the predictor is sometimes referred to as the independent variable. One way to think about this is that the dependent variable depends or is a function of the other attributes of interest. In linear regression terms, it could also be said that the independent variable explains variation in the dependent variable (more on this later).\nOf note, variable is a typical word used in statistics, I’ve come to like the word attribute instead of variable. I will tend to use attribute, as in, a data attribute, but these are roughly interchangeable in my terminology.\nWe may write this general model as:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere \\(Y\\) is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating. More on this later too.\nSpecific example The data used for this section of the course is from the 2019 WNBA season. These data are part of the bayesrules package/book. The data contain 146 rows, one for each WNBA player sampled, and 32 attributes for that player.

That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season.\nOne first step in an analysis would be to explore each distribution independently first. I’m going to leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.\nThe next step would be to explore the bivariate figure of these two attributes. As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates. This can be done in R with the following code.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) Questions to consider What can be noticed about the relationship between these two attributes? Does there appear to be a relationship between the two? Is this relationship perfect?    Adding a smoother line Adding a smoother line to the figure can help to guide how strong the relationship may be. In general, there are two types of smoothers that we will consider in this course. One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI’m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n\\[ Avg\\_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes\\_Played + \\epsilon \\]\nOne way to read this equation is that the number of minutes played for each player helps to understand variation or differences in the average points scored for that player. Or, average points is modeled or explained by minutes played.\nFor the R formula, instead of an $ = $, you could insert a ~.\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg) ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.13562456 0.01014207  Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n\\[ \\hat{avg\\_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min\\_played \\]\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0 ## [1] 1.1356 1.1356 + .0101 * 1 ## [1] 1.1457 1.1356 + .0101 * 100 ## [1] 2.1456 1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$avg_points) ## [1] 1.189732 1.1356 + .0101 * 5000 ## [1] 51.6356 1.1356 + .0101 * -50 ## [1] 0.6306 Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept (\\(\\beta_{0}\\)), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, (\\(\\beta_{1}\\)), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn’t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\]\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course. More specifically, the variance in the outcome can be partioned or split into two components, those that the independent attribute helped to explain vs those that it can not explain. The part that can be explained is sometimes referred to as the sum of squares regression (SSR), the portion that is unexplained is referred to as the sum of squares error (SSE). This could be written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 + \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 \\]\nLet’s try to visualize what this means.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + mean(avg_points) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FF7F7F\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#65a765\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(mean(avg_points) + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FFD580\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)   Another related measure of error Another way to get a measure of how well the model is performing, would be a statistic called R-squared.

To use the function, you can replace “outcome” with an attribute name from the data above and “predictor” with another attribute above.\nWhat happens when you flip the outcome / predictor outcomes when computing the correlation? Does the correlation change? Why or why not? Given the correlation computed, how is it interpreted? Given the correlation computed, what information would this tell us when we try estimate the regression coefficients below?  cor(outcome ~ predictor, data = penguins, use = \u0026#39;complete.obs\u0026#39;) |\u0026gt; round(3)  Visualize bivariate distribution The following code creates a scatter plot showing the bivariate association between the two attributes entered. Example code is shown below as an example. You can replace the “outcome” and “predictor” with the two continuous attributes that you are interested in exploring. These need to be entered in quotations, either single or double are fine. You can also add a regression line or smoother line by specifying those arguments as either TRUE (ie., Yes) or FALSE (ie., No).\nDoes the association between the two attributes appear to be linear? What happens to the association if you flip the predictor / outcome attributes? How would you summarize the association in a few sentences?  visualize_relationship(outcome = \u0026#39;bill_length_mm\u0026#39;, predictor = \u0026#39;flipper_length_mm\u0026#39;, data = penguins, add_regression_line = TRUE, add_smoother_line = FALSE) ## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. ## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was ## generated. ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`). ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).  Linear Regression Fitting Similar to the bivariate scatterplot, the following function was created to fit a linear regression and extract some information about the model. The output should include the Intercept, Slope, R-square, and sigma estimates. You can specify the outcome and predictor by replacing those as you did in the bivariate scatterplot above to reflect the attributes you are interested in exploring.\nHow are the 4 estimates interpreted, particularly in the context of the problem? What happens to the 4 estimates if you flip the outcome and predictor attributes?  Which one should truly be the outcome and what should guide this?   model_fit(outcome = \u0026#39;bill_length_mm\u0026#39;, predictor = \u0026#39;flipper_length_mm\u0026#39;, data = penguins) ## Intercept Slope Rsquare sigma ## 1 -7.264868 0.2547682 0.430574 4.125874  ","date":1693267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693267200,"objectID":"730e6344c2a80c627178c5d190900d5b","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/02a-in-class-activity/","publishdate":"2023-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/02a-in-class-activity/","section":"lectures","summary":"In Class Activity - August 29, 2023 This activity is meant to give you some exploration of topics within class.

This can be helpful when 0 is not a practically useful characteristic of the attribute or for more specific tests of certain elements of the X attribute.\nMean Centering Mean centering is where the mean of the attribute is subtracted from each value. This is a linear transformation where each data point is subtracted by a constant, the mean. This means that the distance between points do not change.\nairquality \u0026lt;- airquality %\u0026gt;% mutate(avg_wind_mc = avg_wind - mean(avg_wind), avg_wind_maxc = avg_wind - max(avg_wind), avg_wind_10 = avg_wind - 10) gf_point(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_mc, data = airquality, size = 4, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Average daily wind speed (in knots)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Daily Air Quality\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;, linetype = 2) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; air_lm_mc \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_mc, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_mc) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_mc ## 38.788011 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_mc)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_mc)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479 air_lm_maxc \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_maxc, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_maxc) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_maxc ## 5.968391 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_maxc)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_maxc)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479 air_lm_10 \u0026lt;- lm(daily_aqi ~ avg_wind_10, data = airquality) coef(air_lm_10) ## (Intercept) avg_wind_10 ## 26.104968 -2.211798 summary(air_lm_10)$r.square ## [1] 0.08528019 summary(air_lm_10)$sigma ## [1] 18.05479   Standardized Regression Another type of regression that can be done is one in which the attributes are standardized prior to estimating the linear regression.

I will show two ways, one is general, the other is specific to this simple case with a single predictor/covariate attribute. In general, linear regression (or more generally the general linear model) uses least square estimation. This means that the the parameters in the model minimize the squared distance between the observed and predicted values. That is, least squares estimates minimize this criterion:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\]\nSpecific example Calculus can be used to show that these two equations can be solved simultanuously to get estimates for \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) that minimize the criterion above. These formulas are:\n\\[ b_{1} = \\frac{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})(Y - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})^2} \\] \\[ b_{0} = \\bar{Y} - b_{1}\\bar{X} \\]\nLet’s use R to get these quantities.\nb1 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind)) * (daily_aqi - mean(daily_aqi))) / sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind))^2) ) b0 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, mean(daily_aqi) - b1 * mean(avg_wind) ) b0 ## [1] 48.22295 b1 ## [1] -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  General Approach When there are more than one predictor, the number of equations gets a bit unyieldy, therefore, there is a general analytic approach that works for any set of predictor attributes. The general approach uses matrix algebra (anyone take linear algebra?), to achieve their estimates. This general form is:\n\\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`} \\mathbf{Y} \\right). \\] Where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector of estimated regression coefficients, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of covariate/predictor attributes (called the design matrix), and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is a vector of the outcome attribute.\nBelow, I show what these would look like for the air quality example that has been used and solve for the regression coefficients.\nX \u0026lt;- model.matrix(air_lm) head(X) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 1 1 2.941667 ## 2 1 2.445833 ## 3 1 1.995833 ## 4 1 3.445833 ## 5 1 1.116667 ## 6 1 6.091667 Y \u0026lt;- as.matrix(airquality$daily_aqi) head(Y) ## [,1] ## [1,] 57 ## [2,] 54 ## [3,] 69 ## [4,] 56 ## [5,] 54 ## [6,] 22 X_X \u0026lt;- solve(t(X) %*% X) X_X ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## (Intercept) 0.0008152474 -1.424894e-04 ## avg_wind -0.0001424894 3.340328e-05 X_Y \u0026lt;- t(X) %*% Y X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 186997 ## avg_wind 731464 X_X %*% X_Y ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 48.222946 ## avg_wind -2.211798 coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798    ","date":1693267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693267200,"objectID":"4f3ecf68d62b085e025f260de84450f2","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/03-regression-estimates/","publishdate":"2023-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/03-regression-estimates/","section":"lectures","summary":"Understanding Regression Parameters This section of notes aims to dig a bit more into what the simple linear regression (ie., regression with a single continuous covariate/attribute) parameter estimates mean.","tags":null,"title":"Regression Estimation","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction This week is an introduction to linear regression.

The reason inference is useful is based on the idea that for most problems the sample is used to approximate the population. Therefore, a subset of the population (the sample) is used to estimate the population parameters that are of most interest. As such, our estimates come with error and this uncertainty we can quantify when making inference about the parameter estimates.\nIn this course, I plan to show you two ways to perform this inference. One of those frameworks will be the classical approach which uses classical statistical theory to estimate the amount of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The second approach will use the bootstrap as a way to computationally estimate the uncertainty. The benefit of the bootstrap is that it comes with fewer assumptions than the classical approach. We will build up to these arguments.\nClassical Inferential Framework The classical inferential framework, sometimes referred to as the null hypothesis significance test (NHST) has been around for more than 100 years. This framework builds off of the idea of a null hypothesis.\nA null hypothesis is typically thought as a hypothesis that assumes there is no relationship or a null effect. Framing this in the regression concept that we have been working with, we could define the following null hypotheses.\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{0} = 0.\\ The\\ population\\ yintercept\\ equals\\ 0. \\]\nor\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = 0.\\ The\\ population\\ slope\\ equals\\ 0. \\]\nIn the following two null hypotheses, represented with \\(H_{0}\\), the population parameters are being assumed to be 0 in the population. This is one definition of a null effect, but is not the only null effect we can define (more on this later). The value defined as a null effect is important as it centers the sampling distribution used for evaluating where the sample estimate falls in that distribution.\nAnother hypothesis is typically defined with the null hypothesis, called the alternative hypothesis. This hypothesis states that there is an effect. Within the linear regression framework, we could write the alternative hypotheses as:\n\\[ H_{A}: \\beta_{0} \\neq 0.\\ The\\ population\\ yintercept\\ is\\ not\\ equal\\ to\\ 0. \\]\nor\n\\[ H_{A}: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0.\\ The\\ population\\ slope\\ is\\ not\\ equal\\ to\\ 0. \\]\nIn the following two alternative hypotheses, represented with \\(H_{A}\\), the population parameters are assumed to be not equal to 0. These can also be one-sided, more on this with an example later.\nEstimating uncertainty in parameter estimates The standard error is used to estimate uncertainty or error in the parameter estimates due to having a sample from the population. More specifically, this means that the entire population is not used to estimate the parameter, therefore the estimate we have is very likely not equal exactly to the parameter. Instead, there is some sort of sampling error involved that we want to quantify. If the sample was collected well, ideally randomly, then the estimate should be unbiased. Unbiased here doesn’t mean that the estimate equals the population parameter, rather, that through repeated sampling, the average of our sample estimates would equal the population parameter.\nAs mentioned, standard errors are used to quantify this uncertainty. In the linear regression case we have explored so far, there are mathematical formula for the standard errors. These are shown below.\n\\[ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{0} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{X}^2}{\\sum \\left( X - \\bar{X} \\right)^2} \\right)} \\]\nand\n\\[ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{1} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{\\sum \\left( X - \\bar{X} \\right)^2}} \\]\nIn the equation above, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), is equal to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{error}}{n - 2}}\\), and \\(n\\) is the sample size (ie, number of rows of data in the model).\nMatrix Representation It is also possible, and more easily extendable, to write the standard error computations or the variance of the estimated parameters in matrix representation. This framework extends beyond the single predictor case (ie. one \\(X\\)), therefore is more readily used in practice.\n\\[ \\hat{var}\\left({\\hat{\\beta}}\\right) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\]\nIn the equation above, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), is equal to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{error}}{n - 2}}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the design matrix from the regression analysis. Finally, to get the standard errors back, you take the square root of the diagonal elements.\n$$ SE( ) =   Data The data for this section of notes will explore data from the Environmental Protection Agency on Air Quality collected for the state of Iowa in 2021.

There are two related pieces that can be computed now, a confidence interval and/or the test-statistic and p-value. Let’s go through both.\nFirst, a confidence interval can be computed. Confidence intervals take the following general form:\n\\[ \\hat{\\beta} \\pm C * SE \\]\nWhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the parameter estimate, \\(C\\) is the confidence level, and \\(SE\\) is the standard error. The parameter estimates and standard errors are what we have already established, the \\(C\\) is the confidence level. This indicates the percentage of times, over the long run/repeated sampling, that the interval will capture the population parameter. Historically, this value is often specified as 95%, but any value is theoretically possible.\nThe \\(C\\) value represents a quantile from a mathematical distribution that separates the middle percetage desired (ie, 95%) from the rest of the distribution. The mathematical distribution is most often the t-distribution, but the difference between a t-distribution and normal distribution are modest once the sample size is greater than 30 or so.\nThe figure below tries to highlight the \\(C\\) value.\nt_30 \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(-5, 5, .01), density = dt(seq(-5, 5, .01), df = 30)) gf_line(density ~ value, data = t_30) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.025, df = 30), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.975, df = 30), linetype = 2) coef(air_lm) ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798 summary(air_lm)$coefficients[,2] ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 0.5155100 0.1043487 abs(qt(.025, df = nrow(airquality) -2)) ## [1] 1.960456 48.2 + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * .5155 ## [1] 47.18962 49.21038 -2.211 + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * .1043 ## [1] -2.415428 -2.006572  Inference with test statistics It is also possible to do inference with a test statistic and computation of a p-value. Inference in this framework can be summarized into the following steps:\nGenerate hypotheses, ie null and alternative hypotheses. Establish an \\(\\alpha\\) value Estimate parameters Compute test statistic Generate p-value  An \\(\\alpha\\) value is the level of significance and represents the probability of obtaining the results due to chance. This is a value that the researcher can select. For a 5% \\(\\alpha\\) value, this is what was used above to compute the confidence intervals.\nThe test statistic is computed as follows:\n\\[ test\\ stat = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta} - hypothesized\\ value}{SE(\\hat{\\beta})} \\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the estimated parameter, \\(SE(\\hat{\\beta})\\) is the standard error of the parameter estimate, and the \\(hypothesized\\ value\\) is the hypothesized value from the null hypothesis. This is often 0, but does not need to be zero.\nLet’s assume the following null/alternative hypotheses:\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = 0 \\\\ H_{A}: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0 \\]\nLet’s use R to compute this test statistic.\nt = (-2.211 - 0) / .1043 t |\u0026gt; round(3) ## [1] -21.198 pt(-21.198, df = nrow(airquality) -2, lower.tail = TRUE) |\u0026gt; round(3) ## [1] 0 t_dist \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(-25, 25, .05), density = dt(seq(-25, 25, .05), df = (nrow(airquality) - 2))) gf_line(density ~ value, data = t_dist) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.025, df = (nrow(airquality) - 2)), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.975, df = (nrow(airquality) - 2)), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ -21.198, color = \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ 21.198, color = \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) summary(air_lm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = daily_aqi ~ avg_wind, data = airquality) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -41.71 -14.38 -0.73 12.43 86.84 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Review assignment 1 briefly prior to starting this assignment.\nQuestions Note: Each question is worth 1 pt unless otherwise specified.\n  Based on your first assignment, are there attributes that could have been missing from the linear regression fitted in assignment 1? That is, is the assumption of all attributes being included in the model appropriate? Why or why not? If not, what other attributes may be of interest?\n  Add one or more of the attributes identified in question 1 to create a multiple regression model. That is, add one or more of the attributes from question 1 while keeping the attribute from assignment 1 into the regression model. Summarize the interpretation of the regression coefficient estimates for this multiple regression model.\n  Estimate model fit indices to compare the model from assignment 1 to the multiple regression fitted in question 2. Does the model improve model fit based on that from assignment 1? Why or why not?\n  Explore and evaluate the model assumptions regarding the residual/error term. Summarize how well the model is meeting the assumptions, citing specific statistics or visualizations to justify your conclusions. In addition, do the model assumptions seem better met compared to those from the regression in assignment 1? 2 pts\n  Summarize the statistical evidence surrounding the null or alternative hypotheses that are being explored for the coefficients entered into the model. Note, I did not explicitly ask you for null/alternative hypotheses, but you may want to write those down for your reference. In a few sentences, describe if the evidence provides support for or against the null hypothesis. Provide specific statistical evidence to support your justification. 2 pts\n  Create confidence intervals for the coefficients in the multiple regression model. Justify your confidence level and interpret the confidence intervals in the context of the data.

Residuals are defined as:\n\\[ Y - \\hat{Y} \\]\nThese are the deviations in the observed scores from the predicted scores from the linear regression. Recall, through least square estimation that these residauls will sum to 0, therefore, their mean would also be equal to 0. However, there are certain conditions about these residuals that are made for the linear regression model to have the inferences be appropriate. We’ll talk more about what the implications for violating these conditions will have on the linear regression model, but first, the conditions.\nApproximately Normally distributed residuals Homogeneity of variance Uncorrelated residuals Error term is uncorrelated with the predictor attribute Linearity and additivity of the model.  Each of these will be discussed in turn.\nData conditions that are not directly testable:\nValidity Representativeness  Approximately Normally distributed residuals The first assumption is that the residuals are at least approximately Normally distributed. This assumption is really only much of a concern when the sample size is small. If the sample size is larger, the Central Limit Thereom (CLT) states that the distribution of the statstics will be approximately normally distributed. The threshold for the CLT to be properly invoked is about 30. Larger then this, the residuals do not need to be approximately normally distributed. Even still, exploring the distribution of the residuals can still be helpful and can also be helpful to identify potential extreme values.\nThis example will make use of the air quality data one more time.\nData The data for this section of notes will explore data from the Environmental Protection Agency on Air Quality collected for the state of Iowa in 2021.

Standardized Residuals Standardized residuals can be another way to explore the residuals. These will now be standardized to have a variance of 1, similar to that of a Z-score.

Homoogeneity of variance is an assumption that states that the variance of the residuals are similar across the predicted or fitted values from the regression line. This assumption can be explored by looking at the residuals (standardized or raw residuals), by the fitted or predicted values. Within this plot, the range of residuals should be similar across the range of fitted or predicted values.\ngf_point(.resid ~ .fitted, data = resid_diagnostics, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;, size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026#39;Fitted Values\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Residuals\u0026#39;) gf_point(.std.resid ~ .fitted, data = resid_diagnostics, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;, size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026#39;Fitted Values\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Standardized Residuals\u0026#39;) Another figure that can also be helpful for the homogeneity of variance assumption is one that rescales the residuals on the y-axis. The rescaling makes all the standardized residuals positive (takes the absolute value) and then takes the square root of this.\nresid_diagnostics %\u0026gt;% mutate(sqrt_abs_sresid = sqrt(abs(.std.resid))) %\u0026gt;% gf_point(sqrt_abs_sresid ~ .fitted, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39;, size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026#39;Fitted Values\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;Sqrt Abs Standardized Residuals\u0026#39;)  Data with high leverage Data with high leverage are extreme values that may significantly impact the regression estimates. These statistics include extreme values for the outcome or predictor attributes. Cook’s distance is one statistic that can help to identify points with high impact/leverage for the regression estimates. Cook’s distance is a statistic that represents how much change there would be in the fitted values if the point was removed when estimating the regression coefficients. There is some disagreement between what type of thresholds to use for Cook’s distance, but one rule of thumb is Cook’s distance greater than 1. There has also been some research showing that Cook’s distance follows an F-distribution, so a more specific value could be computed. The rule of thumb for greater than 1 comes from the F distribution for large samples.\nresid_diagnostics %\u0026gt;% mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) %\u0026gt;% gf_col(.cooksd ~ obs_num, fill = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Observation Number\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Cook\u0026#39;s Distance\u0026quot;) Another leave one out statistic is the studentized deleted residuals. These are computed by removing a data point, refitting the regression model, then generate a predicted value for the X value for the data point removed. Then the residual is computed the same as before and is standardized like the standardized residuals above. The function in R to compute these is rstudent().\nhead(rstudent(air_lm)) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.8465904 0.6196587 1.3956793 0.8529524 0.4568561 -0.7062271 airquality$student_residuals \u0026lt;- rstudent(air_lm) head(airquality) ## # A tibble: 6 × 15 ## date id poc pm2.5 daily_aqi site_name aqs_parameter_desc cbsa_code ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1/1/21 190130009 1 15.1 57 Water To… PM2.5 - Local Con… 47940 ## 2 1/4/21 190130009 1 13.3 54 Water To… PM2.5 - Local Con… 47940 ## 3 1/7/21 190130009 1 20.5 69 Water To… PM2.5 - Local Con… 47940 ## 4 1/10/21 190130009 1 14.3 56 Water To… PM2.5 - Local Con… 47940 ## 5 1/13/21 190130009 1 13.7 54 Water To… PM2.5 - Local Con… 47940 ## 6 1/16/21 190130009 1 5.3 22 Water To… PM2.5 - Local Con… 47940 ## # ℹ 7 more variables: cbsa_name \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, county \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, avg_wind \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # max_wind \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, max_wind_hours \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, residuals \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # student_residuals \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; airquality %\u0026gt;% mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) %\u0026gt;% gf_point(student_residuals ~ obs_num, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~ 3, color = \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Observation Number\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Studentized Residuals\u0026quot;) Leverage can be another measure to help detect outliers in X values. The hat values that were computed from the augment() function above and can be interpreted as the distance the X scores are from the center of all X predictors. In the case of a single predictor, the hat values are the distance the X score is from the mean of X. The hat values will also sum up to the number of predictors and will always range between 0 and 1.\nresid_diagnostics %\u0026gt;% mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) %\u0026gt;% gf_col(.hat ~ obs_num, fill = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;black\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Observation Number\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Hat Values (leverage)\u0026quot;) plot(air_lm, which = 1:5)  Solutions to overcome data conditions not being met There are some strategies that can be done when a variety of data conditions for linear regression have not been met. In general, the strategies stem around generalizing the model and adding some complexity.\nThe following are options that would be possible:\nAdd interactions or other non-linear terms Use more complicated model  weighted least squares for homogeneity of variance concerns models that include measurement error mixed models for correlated data  Transform the data.

Explore the research question from #1 descriptively. Summarize key similarities/differences from the descriptive analysis. Note, for this first part, include just a single categorical predictor in your research questions.\n  Fit a linear regression model to explore the research question from #1. Interpret each regression coefficient estimate from the linear regression model. That is, what do the specific linear regression coefficients mean in the context of the data problem at hand?\n  Evaluate the linear regression data conditions/assumptions for the model fitted in #3. Summarize the degree to which the model meets the statistical assumptions of linear regression.\n  Summarize the statistical evidence to answer the research question from #1. Be as specific as possible about which tests you are exploring and whether the statistical evidence supports or does not support the null hypothesis.\n  Add any predictors you think may help increase the utility of the statistical model fitted as main effects/additive effects. Note, you are welcome to include more than one attribute in this step, but include at least one. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s not consider any interactions, make sure the terms are additive.\n Perform model comparisons to identify the extent to which this second model performs better than the first model fitted in #3. Summarize the evidence for which model is fitting the data the best. Do the primary conclusions from the model fitted in #3 differ for the first categorical attribute considered?    Attempt to create a figure that captures/summarizes the key takeaway from the statistical results/conclusions from #5. Why did you choose this figure to highlight the statistical results/conclusions?\n  Part 2  Explore an interaction between two categorical attributes. Ensure both categorical attributes are included as main effects too.\n Interpret the interaction estimate. That is, what do the parameter estimates mean in the context of the data? Note: I recommend including at most a two-way interaction effect (i.e., an interaction between two attributes) to promote interpretability here. Also, as part of the interpretation, what does the statistical evidence suggest about whether the interaction effect differs from 0?    Create a figure that summarizes the key statistical results from the model from #7. In a few sentences, describe why this figure is appropriate to summarize the statistical results.\n  Build a new model that adds a new interaction effect between a categorical and a continuous attribute (ensure both terms are included as main effects as well). Note, this model could be the one that you built in part 1 of this assignment, for example with #5. I recommend to aid in interpretability for this assignment, just include one categorical, one continuous, and the interaction effect.\n Interpret the interaction estimate, that is, what does the interaction parameter estimate mean in the context of the data? As part of the intepretation, what does the statistical evidence suggest about whether the interaction effect differs from 0?    Create a figure that summarizes the key statistical results from the model from #9.

The primary benefit of the bootstrap is that it comes with fewer assumptions then the NHST framework. The only real assumption when doing a bootstrap approach is that the sample is obtained randomly from the population, an assumption already made in the NHST framework. The primary drawback of the bootstrap approach is that it is computationally expensive, therefore, it can take time to peform the procedure.\nBootstrapping Steps The following are the steps when performing a bootstrap.\nTreat the sample data as the population.

The primary benefit of the bootstrap is that it comes with fewer assumptions then the NHST framework. The only real assumption when doing a bootstrap approach is that the sample is obtained randomly from the population, an assumption already made in the NHST framework. The primary drawback of the bootstrap approach is that it is computationally expensive, therefore, it can take time to perform the procedure.\nBootstrapping Steps The following are the steps when performing a bootstrap.\nTreat the sample data as the population.

How well is the overall model doing? Are both terms important in understanding variation in admission rates? How can you tell?   Variance decomposition Ultimately, multiple regression is a decomposition of variance. Recall,\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 + \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\\\[10pt] SS_{Total} = SS_{Regression} + SS_{Error} \\]\nMultiple regression still does this, but now, there are two attributes going into helping explain variation in the regression portion of the variance decomposition. How is this variance decomposed by default? For linear regression, the variance decomposition is commonly done using type I sum of square decomposition. What does this mean? Essentially, this means that additional terms are added to determine if they help explain variation over and above the other terms in the model. This is a conditional variance added. For example, given the model above, the variance decomposition could be broken down into the following.\n\\[ SS_{Total} = SS_{Regression} + SS_{Error} \\\\[10pt] SS_{Total} = SS_{X_{1}} + SS_{X_{2} | X_{1}} + SS_{Error} \\]\nact_lm \u0026lt;- lm(adm_rate ~ actcmmid, data = college) summary(act_lm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = adm_rate ~ actcmmid, data = college) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.71615 -0.12521 0.02024 0.14490 0.37314 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

How well is the overall model doing? Are both terms important in understanding variation in admission rates? How can you tell?   Variance decomposition Ultimately, multiple regression is a decomposition of variance. Recall,\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 + \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\\\[10pt] SS_{Total} = SS_{Regression} + SS_{Error} \\]\nMultiple regression still does this, but now, there are two attributes going into helping explain variation in the regression portion of the variance decomposition. How is this variance decomposed by default? For linear regression, the variance decomposition is commonly done using type I sum of square decomposition. What does this mean?

That is, there is a test statistic that aims to test if the model is explaining variation over and above a simple mean. More specifically, this omnibus hypothesis tests the following:\n\\[ H_{0}: All\\ \\beta = 0 \\\\[10pt] H_{A}: Any\\ \\beta \\neq 0 \\]\nThis hypothesis can be formally tested with an F-statistic which is distributed as an F distribution with \\(p\\) predictor attributes and \\(n - p - 1\\) degrees of freedom.\nf_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(0, 5, by = .01)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(dens = df(value, 2, 1278)) gf_line(dens ~ value, data = f_data, size = 2) f_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(0, 5, by = .01)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(dens = df(value, 5, 50)) gf_line(dens ~ value, data = f_data, size = 2)  Adjusted R-squared The adjusted R-squared is typically used when comparing models. This statistic is commonly used as R-square represents the ratio between explained and total variance, therefore, this will always increase, even if the new attribute entered is not helpful. The adjusted R-squared tries to adjust for model complexity. There are many ways to do this, but the most common will be defined here.\n\\[ \\bar{R}^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) \\frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1} \\]\nor\n\\[ \\bar{R}^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res} / df_{e}}{SS_{tot} / df_{t}} \\] where \\(p\\) is the number of predictors (excluding the intercept), \\(n\\) is the sample size, \\(SS_{e}\\) and \\(SS_{tot}\\) are sum of square residual and total respectively, and \\(df_{e}\\) and \\(df_{t}\\) are degrees of freedom for the error (\\(n - p - 1\\)) and total (\\(n - 1\\)) respectively.\nsummary(adm_mult_reg) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = adm_rate ~ act_mean + cost_mean, data = college) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.65484 -0.12230 0.02291 0.13863 0.37054 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

What about linear regression?\n Linear Regression with Categorical Attributes Since these notes are happening, you can assume it is possible. But how can a categorical attribute with categories rather than numbers be included in the linear regression model?\nThe answer is that they can’t. We need a new representation of the categorical attribute, enter dummy or indicator coding.\nDummy/Indicator Coding Suppose we use the following logic:\nIf NL, then give a value of 1, else give a value of 0.\nDoes this give the same information as before?\n  League ID Dummy League ID    AL 0  NL 1    What would this look like for the actual data?\ncareer \u0026lt;- career %\u0026gt;% mutate(league_dummy = ifelse(lgID == \u0026#39;NL\u0026#39;, 1, 0)) head(career, n = 10) ## # A tibble: 10 × 6 ## name lgID H AB average league_dummy ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Jeff Abbott AL 127 459 0.277 0 ## 2 Kurt Abbott AL 33 123 0.268 0 ## 3 Kurt Abbott NL 455 1780 0.256 1 ## 4 Reggie Abercrombie NL 54 255 0.212 1 ## 5 Brent Abernathy AL 194 767 0.253 0 ## 6 Shawn Abner AL 81 309 0.262 0 ## 7 Shawn Abner NL 19 115 0.165 1 ## 8 CJ Abrams NL 70 284 0.246 1 ## 9 Bobby Abreu AL 858 3061 0.280 0 ## 10 Bobby Abreu NL 1602 5373 0.298 1 Now that there is a numeric attribute, these can be added into the linear regression model.\naverage_lm \u0026lt;- lm(average ~ league_dummy, data = career) broom::tidy(average_lm) ## # A tibble: 2 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.252 0.000758 333. 0 ## 2 league_dummy 0.000558 0.00107 0.522 0.602 How are these terms interpreted now?\ndf_stats(average ~ league_dummy, data = career, mean, sd, length) ## response league_dummy mean sd length ## 1 average 0 0.2518959 0.02895094 1461 ## 2 average 1 0.2524535 0.02896021 1477 average_lm2 \u0026lt;- lm(average ~ lgID, data = career) broom::tidy(average_lm2) ## # A tibble: 2 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.252 0.000758 333. 0 ## 2 lgIDNL 0.000558 0.00107 0.522 0.602 t.test(average ~ lgID, data = career, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: average by lgID ## t = -0.52189, df = 2936, p-value = 0.6018 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group AL and group NL is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.002652537 0.001537330 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group AL mean in group NL ## 0.2518959 0.2524535   Values other than 0/1 First, I want to build off of the first part of the notes on regression with categorical predictors.

Before moving to why you should care, let’s more formally talk about type I errors. Suppose we have the following table of possible outcomes:\n     \\(H_{0}\\) true \\(H_{0}\\) false    Reject \\(H_{0}\\) Type I Error (\\(\\alpha\\)) Correct - Power (\\(1 - \\beta\\))  Retain \\(H_{0}\\) Correct (\\(1 - \\alpha\\)) Type II Error (\\(\\beta\\))    Type I error is when the null hypothesis is true in the population, but the statistical evidence supports the alternative hypothesis. Type II error is when the null hypothesis is false in the population, but the statistical evidence supports the null hypothesis.\nHere is a good link for an interactive app that shows many of these terms visually: https://rpsychologist.com/d3/nhst/.\nType M and Type S errors These were first defined by Gelman and Tuerlinckx (2000) and is also in section 4.4 of Regression and Other Stories textbook.\n Type S (sign) occurs when the sign of the estimated effect is in the opposite direction as the true effect. Type M (magnitude) occurse when the magnitude of the estimated effect is much different (often larger) than the true effect.  These really shift the narrative away from achieving statistical signficiance and moving toward proper estimation of effects or precision, this is a better goal in my opinion.\n  Holm-Bonferroni Procedure The boneferroni procedure will be overly conservative and I wouldn’t recommend it’s use in practice. If you want a simple approach to p-value adjustment, I’d recommend just setting a specific value for the alpha value to be more conservative, for example setting it to 0.01.\nThe Holm-Bonferroni approach is an adjustment method that is more powerful then the original bonferroni procedure, but does not come with onerous assumptions. The Holm-Boneferroni procedure uses the following steps for adjustment.\nSuppose there are \\(m\\) p-values (ie, \\(m\\) null hypotheses). First, order these from smallest to largest, be sure to keep track of which hypothese the p-value is associated with. Then, 1. Is the smallest p-value less than \\(\\alpha / m\\), if yes, provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis and proceed to the next p-value, it not stop. 2. Is the second smallest p-value less than $ / m - 1$, if eys, provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis and proceed to the next p-value, if not stop. 3. Continue, comparing the p-values in order to the following adjust alpha,\n\\[ \\alpha_{new_{k}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{m + 1 - k} \\]\nwhere is \\(k\\) is the rank of the p-values when ordered from smallest to largest.\nSimilar to the bonferroni, the p-values can be adjusted with the following formula:\n\\[ p_{adj} = min(1, max((m + 1 - k) * p_{k} )) \\]\nwhere is \\(k\\) is the rank of the p-values when ordered from smallest to largest.\npairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;holm\u0026#39;) ## ## Pairwise comparisons using t tests with pooled SD ## ## data: career$average and career$position ## ## catcher dh infield ## dh 0.00012 - - ## infield 2.5e-13 1.00000 - ## outfield 3.0e-16 1.00000 0.52730 ## ## P value adjustment method: holm pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value ## catcher dh infield ## dh 2.880340e-05 NA NA ## infield 5.033217e-14 0.5013190 NA ## outfield 4.974152e-17 0.8510978 0.1757679 pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value[3] * (6 + 1 - 1) ## [1] 2.984491e-16 pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value[2] * (6 + 1 - 2) ## [1] 2.516609e-13 pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value[1] * (6 + 1 - 3) ## [1] 0.0001152136 pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value[9] * (6 + 1 - 4) ## [1] 0.5273037 pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value[5] * (6 + 1 - 5) ## [1] 1.002638 pairwise.t.test(career$average, career$position, p.adjust = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;)$p.value[6] * (6 + 1 - 6) ## [1] 0.8510978  Exploring assumptions/Data Conditions for model with categorical attributes plot(position_lm, which = 1:5)   ","date":1696896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"514cdbd530895816f4e29e2c55a35cdc","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/11-pairwise/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/11-pairwise/","section":"lectures","summary":"More details on pairwise contrasts Last week the idea of pairwise contrasts were introduced.

This may not be a predictor that is of most interest to our research question of knowing whether or not there are differences in birth weight between those that smoked vs did not smoke when the baby was in the womb. There may be some sampling bias occurring, that is, those that smoked may have fewer gestational days compared to those that did not smoke. This fact may drive the differences in the mean difference of birth weight. As a results, we would want to adjust for the effect of gestational days prior to evaluating the mean difference of smoker status.\nBelow is a descriptive figure trying to show the relationship between birth weight and gestational days by smoker status.\ngf_point(birth_weight ~ gestational_days, data = baby, color = ~maternal_smoker, size = 4) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, size = 1) ## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0. ## ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was ## generated.

Although, this is a classical assumption, this is an empirical question that we can explore given the data. This can be explored by the introduction of an interaction.\nThis new model would be:\n\\[ weight = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} days + \\beta_{2} smoker + \\beta_{3} days:smoker + \\epsilon \\]\nwhere the \\(:\\) in the equation above represents the interaction effect between gestational days and smoker status. An interaction is testing if the slope for gestational days is the same for those that smoke vs those that did not smoke.\nMore explicitly, we can partition the model above into the following two regression equations.\n\\[ weight_{smoker} = (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{2}) + (\\beta_{1} + \\beta_{3}) days + \\epsilon \\]\n\\[ weight_{non-smoker} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} days + \\epsilon \\]\nbaby_lm_int \u0026lt;- lm(birth_weight ~ gestational_mean * maternal_smoker, data = baby) # baby_lm_int \u0026lt;- lm(birth_weight ~ gestational_mean + maternal_smoker + gestational_mean:maternal_smoker, # data = baby) glance(baby_lm_int) ## # A tibble: 1 × 12 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 0.225 0.223 16.2 113. 2.41e-64 3 -4930. 9871. 9896. ## # ℹ 3 more variables: deviance \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, df.residual \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;, nobs \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; tidy(baby_lm_int) |\u0026gt; mutate_if(is.double, round, 3) ## # A tibble: 4 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 123. 0.605 203. 0 ## 2 gestational_mean 0.37 0.037 10.1 0 ## 3 maternal_smokerTRUE -8.26 0.969 -8.52 0 ## 4 gestational_mean:maternal_smokerTRUE 0.231 0.062 3.74 0 What do the 4 terms represent now?\n\\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept for the reference group (non-smokers) when all other attributes in the model are equal to 0. \\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope for the reference group (non-smokers), controlling for the smoker status. \\(\\beta_{2}\\) is the average change for those that smoke, controlling for differences in gestational days. \\(\\beta_{3}\\) is the average slope difference for those that smoke compared to those that did not smoke.  Often, it is easier to combine the terms to be compared directly. For example, given the example above, we could combine \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) to get the estimated intercept for those that smoke. Then we could do something similar for the slope terms for those that smoke.\nHypotheses being tested The hypotheses being tested here for the \\(\\beta_{2}\\) and \\(\\beta_{3}\\) are as follows:\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{2} = 0 \\]\nand\n\\[ H_{0}: \\beta_{3} = 0 \\]\nThese can be a little bit untenable, therefore stating them in words can help.\n \\(H_{0}: \\beta_{2} = 0\\), is really testing, is there a mean difference between the reference and focal groups, controlling for the other terms in the model. This is inherently a conditional or adjusted means question. \\(H_{0}: \\beta_{3} = 0\\), is really testing, is there a slope difference comparing the focal and reference groups, controlling for other terms in the model.    Including more than 1 covariate to adjust/condition It is also possible to adjust for more than one covariate. For example, maybe we thought adjusting for the weight, height, and age of the mother would also be a good idea. This can be done to remove any variation associated with that attribute prior to making exploring the mean difference in the attributes of interest.\nThis model would now be:\n\\[ weight = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} days + \\beta_{4} mother\\_weight + \\beta_{5} mother\\_height + \\beta_{6} mother\\_age + \\beta_{2} smoker + \\beta_{3} days:smoker + \\epsilon \\]\nThese can also be partitioned into two separate equations.\n\\[ weight_{smoker} = (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{2}) + (\\beta_{1} + \\beta_{3}) days + \\beta_{4} mother\\_weight + \\beta_{5} mother\\_height + \\beta_{6} mother\\_age + \\epsilon \\]\n\\[ weight_{non-smoker} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} days + \\beta_{4} mother\\_weight + \\beta_{5} mother\\_height + \\beta_{6} mother\\_age + \\epsilon \\]\nbaby_lm_int_w \u0026lt;- lm(birth_weight ~ gestational_mean + maternal_pregnancy_weight + maternal_height + maternal_age + maternal_smoker + gestational_mean:maternal_smoker, data = baby) glance(baby_lm_int_w) ## # A tibble: 1 × 12 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 0.260 0.256 15.8 68.3 6.14e-73 6 -4903. 9822. 9863. ## # ℹ 3 more variables: deviance \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, df.residual \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;, nobs \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; tidy(baby_lm_int_w) |\u0026gt; mutate_if(is.double, round, 3) ## # A tibble: 7 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 43.5 12.3 3.54 0 ## 2 gestational_mean 0.365 0.036 10.1 0 ## 3 maternal_pregnancy_weight 0.052 0.025 2.06 0.039 ## 4 maternal_height 1.10 0.204 5.41 0 ## 5 maternal_age 0.07 0.081 0.873 0.383 ## 6 maternal_smokerTRUE -8.20 0.952 -8.62 0 ## 7 gestational_mean:maternal_smokerTRUE 0.208 0.061 3.44 0.001 How could the appropriate conditional means be computed here?

The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous attributes. One of those attributes will be the outcome or attribute of interest whereas the other will used as a predictor. The outcome or attribute of interest is sometimes referred to as the dependent variable and the predictor is sometimes referred to as the independent variable. One way to think about this is that the dependent variable depends or is a function of the other attributes of interest. In linear regression terms, it could also be said that the independent variable explains variation in the dependent variable (more on this later).\nOf note, variable is a typical word used in statistics, I’ve come to like the word attribute instead of variable. I will tend to use attribute, as in, a data attribute, but these are roughly interchangeable in my terminology.\nWe may write this general model as:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere \\(Y\\) is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating. More on this later too.\nSpecific example The data used for this section of the course is from the 2019 WNBA season. These data are part of the bayesrules package/book.

That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season.\nOne first step in an analysis would be to explore each distribution independently first. I’m going to leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.\nThe next step would be to explore the bivariate figure of these two attributes. As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates. This can be done in R with the following code.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) |\u0026gt; gf_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; cor(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) |\u0026gt; round(3) ## [1] 0.848 round(cor(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball), 3) ## [1] 0.848 Questions to consider What can be noticed about the relationship between these two attributes? Does there appear to be a relationship between the two? Is this relationship perfect?    Adding a smoother line Adding a smoother line to the figure can help to guide how strong the relationship may be. In general, there are two types of smoothers that we will consider in this course. One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI’m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(linewidth = 2.5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linewidth = 2.5, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; filter(basketball, total_minutes \u0026lt;= 0) ## # A tibble: 1 × 32 ## player_name height weight year team age games_played games_started ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Angel McCoughtry 73 173 2019 ATL 32 1 1 ## # ℹ 24 more variables: avg_minutes_played \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, avg_field_goals \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # avg_field_goal_attempts \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, field_goal_pct \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # avg_three_pointers \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, avg_three_pointer_attempts \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # three_pointer_pct \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, avg_two_pointers \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # avg_two_pointer_attempts \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, two_pointer_pct \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # avg_free_throws \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, avg_free_throw_attempts \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, free_throw_pct \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # avg_offensive_rb \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, avg_defensive_rb \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, avg_rb \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, …  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n\\[ Avg\\_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes\\_Played + \\epsilon \\]\nOne way to read this equation is that the number of minutes played for each player helps to understand variation or differences in the average points scored for that player. Or, average points is modeled or explained by minutes played.\nFor the R formula, instead of an $ = $, you could insert a ~.\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg) |\u0026gt; round(4) ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.1356 0.0101 100 * .01 ## [1] 1  Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n\\[ \\hat{avg\\_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min\\_played \\]\n\\[ avg\\_points = 1.1356 + .0101 min\\_played + \\epsilon \\]\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0 ## [1] 1.1356 1.1356 + .0101 * 1 ## [1] 1.1457 1.1356 + .0101 * 100 ## [1] 2.1456 1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$total_minutes) ## [1] 5.342042 1.1356 + .0101 * 5000 ## [1] 51.6356 1.1356 + .0101 * -50 ## [1] 0.6306 1.1356 + .0101 * -5000 ## [1] -49.3644 Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept (\\(\\beta_{0}\\)), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, (\\(\\beta_{1}\\)), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, linewidth = 3, color = \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_histogram(~ avg_points, data = basketball)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn’t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\]\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course. More specifically, the variance in the outcome can be partioned or split into two components, those that the independent attribute helped to explain vs those that it can not explain. The part that can be explained is sometimes referred to as the sum of squares regression (SSR), the portion that is unexplained is referred to as the sum of squares error (SSE). This could be written in math notation as:\n\\[ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 + \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 \\]\n\\[ \\hat{Y} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} minutes \\]\n\\[ SS_{reg} = \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 \\]\n\\[ SS_{error} = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 \\]\n\\[ SS_{Total} = \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 \\]\nLet’s try to visualize what this means.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + mean(avg_points) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FF7F7F\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#65a765\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;) gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = \u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, linetype = 2, color = \u0026#39;lightblue\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(mean(avg_points) + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = \u0026#39;#FFD580\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)   Another related measure of error Another way to get a measure of how well the model is performing, would be a statistic called R-squared.

Take a few minutes to reacquaint yourself with this analysis, including the linear regression estimates obtained.\n  Was the intercept from the linear regression fitted in activity 2 using the raw data as it was collected interpretable in the context of the data? Rephrasing slightly, could the intercept term be made more interpretable? If so, how?\n  Fit a modified linear regression that performs a centering. That is, center the distance in some fashion. Options could include, minimum, mean, median, maximum, etc centering. What changed for the estimates obtained from the model?\n Which model, the centered or the uncentered, do you feel has a stronger justification for its usage? Be as specific as possible in your rationale.    Use whichever model you feel is the best from #3, then extract from software or compute the standard errors for the estimated regression coefficients. Interpret these standard errors in the context of the problem.\n  Compute confidence intervals for the two regression coefficients. Justify your choice for level of confidence and interpret the confidence interval.\n  Finally, perform hypothesis testing for the two regression coefficients. In this, set up the null/alternative hypotheses and then interpret the statistical results to provide a statistical conclusion. More specifically, what does the hypothesis test suggest about the null and alternative hypotheses?\n  Question 6 talked about the statistical conclusions, now compare/contrast this with practical conclusions. More specifically, would these results be useful in practice? Be as specific as possible in your response.\n  ","date":1695686400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695686400,"objectID":"2b4830c801d0b64f1e5498731a72e54f","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/assignments/activity/activity3/","publishdate":"2023-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/activity/activity3/","section":"assignments","summary":"The following activity is aimed to give you some practice with exploring data and running a linear regression on your own using statistical software.

In a couple of sentences, provide an answer to the research question.\n  Extract the residuals from one of the linear regressions using the centered or uncentered regressions (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which one). Perform a descriptive analysis on these residuals. This could include graphically visualizing the distribution and/or computing summary statistics on the residuals.\n  Evaluate the residuals for the assumption of normality of the residuals. How may the results be impacted by any deviation of normality?\n  Evaluate the residuals for the assumption of homogeneity of variance. How may the results be impacted by any deviation of homogeneity of variance?\n  Are there any noticeable trends in the residuals? What implications could this have for the analysis? If a trend in the residuals exists, what may be a cause for this trend?\n  Explore the model to identify if there are any points that have high leverage or could be identified as extreme values. It may be worth exploring studentized residuals, cook\u0026rsquo;s distance, and/or leverage values.\n  ","date":1666051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666051200,"objectID":"5332526da9a7c6e4edea1e846b3d68ba","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/assignments/activity/activity4/","publishdate":"2022-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/activity/activity4/","section":"assignments","summary":"The following activity is aimed to give you some practice with exploring data and running a linear regression on your own using statistical software.
