Students are assumed to have some background in statistical concepts and have a basic understanding of common descriptive statistics and bivariate association (e.g., Pearson correlation).\nThis course will focus on using statistical methods to answer research questions and make decisions from data. General linear models (i.e., regression) will serve as the fundamental building block that students will be exposed to answer questions about associations of quantitative outcomes with quantitative and categorical predictors. Statistical estimation, model building, and inference using statistical software will serve as primary topics which students will gain a stronger understanding by the end of the course.\nCourse Objectives The course requirements and class materials are aimed to help students achieve the following course objectives:\n become more fluent in statistical terminology, use statistical software, turn research questions into actionable statistical methods, engage with statistical theory, connect model equations with statistical code, summarize uncertainty and variation in estimation.  Textbook  Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd edition), by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani: https://www.statlearning.com/ Supplemental Text:  Statistical Reasoning through Computation and R, by LeBeau and Zieffler: https://lebebr01.github.io/stat_thinking/ Introduction to Modern Statistics, by Cetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. Found online here: https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/ Applied Regression: An Introduction, by Lewis-Beck and Lewis-Beck. Online access via library: https://dx-doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.4135/9781483396774.n1.   Class notes and Jupyter Notebooks used in class will also be shared through the course website.  Course Requirements   Online Quizzes: There will be a total of 10 online quizzes taken through ICON. Each quiz will be available for 5 to 7 days and are open note/book, but should be completed independently and will need to be completed in a single occasion. Expect each quiz to be about 10 questions. The dates will be discussed in class and announcements will be sent by email to communicate when quizzes open and close. Quizzes will account for 40% of the course grade.\n  Assignments: 4 assignments spread throughout the course will be used to improve student understanding and give students practice to work with data. These assignments can be completed within small groups of no more than 3 students. If completed as a group, all students will receive the same score and only one assignment with everyone\u0026rsquo;s name on it needs to be turned in. Assignments will account for 40% of the course grade.\n  Activities: Approximately 6 activities will be posted across the semester. These are complete/incomplete activities, therefore, completing these will give you 20% of the final course grade. Completion of these involve posting answers to the questions that show you interacted and engaged in the activity. Answers that are not on topic or missing will not count as \u0026ldquo;passing\u0026rdquo; for that activity. These activities are meant to be formative assessments to give you time to practice interpreting statistics. Similar to the assignments, you may work in groups of up to 3 to complete these activities, in which you would all receive the same pass/fail grade for the activity.\n  Absences: Absences happen. Therefore, I ask you to be as transparent as possible with me. I promise to be compassionate and understanding. If at any point in the semester you are having difficulties, please reach out to me and I will do my best to be accommodating and provide support, which could include an extension on course deadlines as necessary.\n  Grading: Final grades will be based on the following weighting scheme:\n 10 quizzes, equally weighted, 40% of total grade 4 assignments, equally weighted, 40% of total grade About 6 activities, equally weighted, 20% of total grade    Percentage Breakdown: Guidelines are given below, plus and minus grades will be given as well. Changes may occur to the grade percentage breakdown below, but the percentages will not get higher. For example, the lower percentage to get a B, could drop to 75%, but will never be higher than 80%. I will do my best to communicate any shifts to these grade ranges as the semester progresses.\n A 90% and above B 80% up to 90% C 70% up to 80% D Below 70%    Course and University Policies  Announcements and Communication: Any announcements regarding the course will be communicated via email so please check it daily.  Email Expectations: I want to be transparent regarding course email. Email is not meant to be an instantaneous exchange, rather, email is asynchronous. I typically will respond to an email within one business day. Note, I typically will not respond to email over the weekend or during evening hours, but there could be exceptions to this. If I do send an email during the evening or weekend, there is no expectation that you reply immediately as well. If a reply is warranted, reply on your own time.   Course Materials: Course materials will be posted to ICON or the course website. Go to icon.uiowa.edu for access to the ICON site and the primary course website for PSQF 6243. Adaptations and Modifications: Please inform me during the first two weeks if you require special adaptations or modifications to any assignment or due dates because of special circumstances such as learning disabilities, religious observances, or other appropriate needs. Contesting a Grade: To contest a grade, please send me an email detailing your reason within 48 hours of receiving the grade. This allows both of us time to think, reflect, and discuss the matter without taking class time from other students. When contesting a grade, provide a copy of the graded assignment. Academic Misconduct: Plagiarism and cheating may result in grade reduction and/or serious penalties. Unless you are otherwise instructed, your work should be entirely your own. Please take care in writing your final project. You should always be writing in your own words, citing others' ideas, and quoting text as appropriate.

University Policies The following University of Iowa course policies are published by the Provost office.\nAt the University of Iowa, we strive for a classroom or laboratory climate that encourages learning while also protecting the freedoms and rights of our students and faculty.\nPlease review the following course policies, expectations, and resources. Visit the Dean of Students website for additional student policies and procedures.\n Statement about COVID-19: The University of Iowa encourages students, faculty, and staff to be vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. The university also welcomes students, faculty, and staff to wear a face mask while on campus, in classroom settings, and during in-person office hours. However, face mask usage is not required except in specified healthcare settings. Free Speech and Expression: The University of Iowa supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principles of academic and artistic freedom. We are committed to open inquiry, vigorous debate, and creative expression inside and outside of the classroom. Visit the Free Speech at Iowa website for more information on the university’s policies on free speech and academic freedom. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University is committed to providing an educational experience that is accessible to all students. If a student has a diagnosed disability or other disabling condition that may impact the student’s ability to complete the course requirements as stated in the syllabus, the student may seek accommodations through Student Disability Services (SDS). SDS is responsible for making Letters of Accommodation (LOA) available to the student. The student must provide a LOA to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, but requests not made at least two weeks prior to the scheduled activity for which an accommodation is sought may not be accommodated. The LOA will specify what reasonable course accommodations the student is eligible for and those the instructor should provide. Additional information can be found on the SDS website. Absences for Religious Holy Days: The University is prepared to make reasonable accommodations for students whose religious holy days coincide with their classroom assignments, test schedules, and classroom attendance expectations. Students must notify their instructors in writing of any such Religious Holy Day conflicts or absences within the first few days of the semester or session, and no later than the third week of the semester. If the conflict or absence will occur within the first three weeks of the semester, the student should notify the instructor as soon as possible. See Operations Manual 8.2 Absences for Religious Holy Days for additional information. Classroom Expectations: Students are expected to comply with University policies regarding appropriate classroom behavior as outlined in the Code of Student Life. While students have the right to express themselves and participate freely in class, it is expected that students will behave with the same level of courtesy and respect in the virtual class setting (whether asynchronous or synchronous) as they would in an in-person classroom. Failure to follow behavior expectations as outlined in the Code of Student Life may be addressed by the instructor and may also result in discipline under the Code of Student Life policies governing E.5 Disruptive Behavior or E.6 Failure to Comply with University Directive. Non-Discrimination Statement: The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination in employment, educational programs, and activities on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, pregnancy, disability, genetic information, status as a U.S. veteran, service in the U.S. military, sexual orientation, gender identity, associational preferences, or any other classification that deprives the person of consideration as an individual. The university also affirms its commitment to providing equal opportunities and equal access to university facilities. For additional information on nondiscrimination policies, contact the Director, Office of Institutional Equity, the University of Iowa, 202 Jessup Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242-1316, 319-335-0705, oie-ui@uiowa.edu. Students may share their pronouns and chosen/preferred names in MyUI, which is accessible to instructors and advisors. Sexual Harassment/Sexual Misconduct and Supportive Measures: The University of Iowa prohibits all forms of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and related retaliation. The Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct governs actions by students, faculty, staff and visitors. Incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct can be reported to the Title IX and Gender Equity Office or to the Department of Public Safety. Students impacted by sexual harassment or sexual misconduct may be eligible for academic supportive measures and can learn more by contacting the Title IX and Gender Equity Office. Information about confidential resources can be found here. Watch the video for an explanation of these resources. Mental Health: Students are encouraged to be mindful of their mental health and seek help as a preventive measure or if feeling overwhelmed and/or struggling to meet course expectations. Students are encouraged to talk to their instructor for assistance with specific class-related concerns. For additional support and counseling, students are encouraged to contact University Counseling Service (UCS). Information about UCS, including resources and how to schedule an appointment, can be found at counseling.uiowa.edu. Find out more about UI mental health services at: mentalhealth.uiowa.edu. Basic Needs and Support for Students: Student Care \u0026amp; Assistance provides assistance to University of Iowa students experiencing a variety of crisis and emergency situations, including but not limited to medical issues, family emergencies, unexpected challenges, and sourcing basic needs such as food and shelter. More information on the resources related to basic needs can be found at: https://basicneeds.uiowa.edu/resources/. Students are encouraged to contact Student Care \u0026amp; Assistance in the Office of the Dean of Students (Room 135 IMU, dos-assistance@uiowa.edu or 319-335-1162) for support and assistance with resources. Sharing of Class Recordings: Students may be enrolled in a class where some sessions will be recorded or live-streamed. Such recordings/streaming will only be available to students registered for the class. These recordings are the intellectual property of the faculty and they may not be shared or reproduced without the explicit, written consent of the faculty member. Further, students may not share these sessions with those not in the class or upload them to any other online environment. Doing so would be a breach of the Code of Student Conduct, and, in some cases, a violation of state and federal law, including the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This course is provided by the College of Education and cross-listed with the Statistics Department. Policies on matters such as course requirements, grading, and sanctions for academic dishonesty are governed by the College of Education. Students wishing to add or drop this course after the official deadline must receive approval of the Dean of the College of Education. See the College of Education policy on cross enrollments.

Upon going here, you will be prompted to log in with your HawkID. Finally, to use the IDAS, you will need to have DUO authentication activated.\nHere is a good link if you have not set up DUO authentication before from ITS. It may take a few hours or up to a day to be granted access to the IDAS after setting up DUO authentication for the first time, DUO Authentication Docs.\nIDAS Specifics The IDAS by default will launch in Jupyter Lab mode and will sync all course materials that I have posted for the course. The syncing of remote materials will never overwrite anything that you have manually edited by you, the student. For this reason, if I notice a breaking change, I usually post a new updated file with a new name.\nYou can also access RStudio server within the IDAS for the course as well. This can be accessed by clicking on \u0026ldquo;RStudio\u0026rdquo; from the launcher page. You should still have access to all of the course files that are automatically synced for you within the RStudio environment.\nShutting down IDAS When you are finished working in the IDAS, you should go to:\n File \u0026gt; Hub Control Panel \u0026gt; Stop My Server  This disconnects/stops the server instance so that the resources can be allocated to others wishing to use the service.\nCommon issues ITS has established a wiki page for common problems that occur and other documentation related to the IDAS.\n","date":1631059200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631059200,"objectID":"4400f965f661bfec3d4ba2892522f833","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/content/00a-idas/","publishdate":"2021-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/00a-idas/","section":"content","summary":"TBD","tags":null,"title":"IDAS Introduction","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction to Linear Regression This week will dive into linear regression, the foundation of this course. The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous attributes. One of those attributes will be the outcome or attribute of interest whereas the other will used as a predictor. The outcome or attribute of interest is sometimes referred to as the dependent variable and the predictor is sometimes referred to as the independent variable. One way to think about this is that the dependent variable depends or is a function of the other attributes of interest. In linear regression terms, it could also be said that the independent variable explains variation in the dependent variable (more on this later).\nOf note, variable is a typical word used in statistics, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to like the word attribute instead of variable. I will tend to use attribute, as in, a data attribute, but these are roughly interchangeable in my terminology.\nWe may write this general model as:\n$$ Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\epsilon $$\nWhere \\(Y\\) is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating.

That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season.\nOne first step in an analysis would be to explore each distribution independently first. I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave that as an exercise for you to do on your own.\nThe next step would be to explore the bivariate figure of these two attributes. As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates. This can be done in R with the following code.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  Questions to consider  What can be noticed about the relationship between these two attributes? Does there appear to be a relationship between the two? Is this relationship perfect?  Adding a smoother line Adding a smoother line to the figure can help to guide how strong the relationship may be. In general, there are two types of smoothers that we will consider in this course. One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess'  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n$$ Avg_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes_Played + \\epsilon $$\nOne way to read this equation is that the number of minutes played for each player helps to understand variation or differences in the average points scored for that player. Or, average points is modeled or explained by minutes played.\nFor the R formula, instead of an $ = $, you could insert a ~.\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg)  ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.13562456 0.01014207  Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n$$ \\hat{avg_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min_played $$\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0  ## [1] 1.1356  1.1356 + .0101 * 1  ## [1] 1.1457  1.1356 + .0101 * 100  ## [1] 2.1456  1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$avg_points)  ## [1] 1.189732  1.1356 + .0101 * 5000  ## [1] 51.6356  1.1356 + .0101 * -50  ## [1] 0.6306  Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept ($\\beta_{0}$), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, ($\\beta_{1}$), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn\u0026rsquo;t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n$$ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) $$\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course. More specifically, the variance in the outcome can be partioned or split into two components, those that the independent attribute helped to explain vs those that it can not explain. The part that can be explained is sometimes referred to as the sum of squares regression (SSR), the portion that is unexplained is referred to as the sum of squares error (SSE). This could be written in math notation as:\n$$ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 + \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to visualize what this means.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + mean(avg_points) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = '#FF7F7F') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = '#65a765') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(mean(avg_points) + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = '#FFD580') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  Another related measure of error Another way to get a measure of how well the model is performing, would be a statistic called R-squared. This statistic is a function of the sum of squares described above.\n$$ R^{2} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{total}} $$\nor\n$$ R^{2} = \\frac{SS_{reg}}{SS_{total}} $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compute the sum of square and get a value for \\(R^2\\).\nbasketball %\u0026gt;% summarise(ss_total = sum((avg_points - mean(avg_points))^2), ss_error = sum((avg_points - fitted(wnba_reg))^2), ss_reg = sum((fitted(wnba_reg) - mean(avg_points))^2)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(r_square = 1 - ss_error / ss_total, r_square2 = ss_reg / ss_total)  ## # A tibble: 1 × 5 ## ss_total ss_error ss_reg r_square r_square2 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 2004. 564. 1440. 0.719 0.719  summary(wnba_reg)$r.square  ## [1] 0.7185315  summary(wnba_reg)$sigma  ## [1] 1.979045  sigma_hat_square \u0026lt;- 563.9929 / (nrow(basketball) - 2) sigma_hat \u0026lt;- sqrt(sigma_hat_square) sigma_hat_square  ## [1] 3.916617  sigma_hat  ## [1] 1.979045  ","date":1661299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661299200,"objectID":"17dfd110f0048310fb5dd77246ebabb6","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/02-linear-regression/","publishdate":"2022-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/02-linear-regression/","section":"lectures","summary":"Introduction to Linear Regression This week will dive into linear regression, the foundation of this course.

The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 continuous attributes. One of those attributes will be the outcome or attribute of interest whereas the other will used as a predictor. The outcome or attribute of interest is sometimes referred to as the dependent variable and the predictor is sometimes referred to as the independent variable. One way to think about this is that the dependent variable depends or is a function of the other attributes of interest. In linear regression terms, it could also be said that the independent variable explains variation in the dependent variable (more on this later).\nOf note, variable is a typical word used in statistics, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to like the word attribute instead of variable. I will tend to use attribute, as in, a data attribute, but these are roughly interchangeable in my terminology.\nWe may write this general model as:\n$$ Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\epsilon $$\nWhere \\(Y\\) is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The \\(X\\) term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating. More on this later too.\nSpecific example The data used for this section of the course is from the 2019 WNBA season. These data are part of the bayesrules package/book.

One is flexible and data dependent. This means that the functional form of the relationship is flexible to allow the data to specify if there are in non-linear aspects. The second is a linear or straight-line approach.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to add both to the figure below. The flexible (in this case this is a LOESS curve) curve is darker blue, the linear line is lighter blue.\nDoes there appear to be much difference in the relationship across the two lines?\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% #gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'lightblue', size = 4) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  cor(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball)  ## [1] 0.8476624  gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(color = 'black', size = 3) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, size = 4, color = 'blue') gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  library(simglm) sim_args \u0026lt;- list( formula = y ~ 1 + poly(x1, degree = 2), fixed = list(x1 = list(var_type = 'continuous')), sample_size = 2000, reg_weights = c(1, 2, -200) ) poly_data \u0026lt;- simulate_fixed(data = NULL, sim_args) |\u0026gt; simulate_error(sim_args) |\u0026gt; generate_response(sim_args) head(poly_data)  ## X.Intercept. x1_1 x1_2 x1 level1_id error ## 1 1 -0.023738970 0.001264975 -1.05732784 1 -0.72911136 ## 2 1 0.001855997 -0.015605511 0.05808737 2 -0.89038148 ## 3 1 0.012546200 -0.010416012 0.52396082 3 0.35416269 ## 4 1 -0.005732009 -0.014914073 -0.27259394 4 -0.95894820 ## 5 1 0.001278362 -0.015680610 0.03291437 5 -0.04970669 ## 6 1 -0.013338978 -0.010574816 -0.60410166 6 0.59216136 ## fixed_outcome random_effects y ## 1 0.699527 0 -0.02958439 ## 2 4.124814 0 3.23443267 ## 3 3.108295 0 3.46245751 ## 4 3.971351 0 3.01240240 ## 5 4.138679 0 4.08897209 ## 6 3.088285 0 3.68044656  gf_point(y ~ x1, data = poly_data, size = 3) |\u0026gt; gf_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'lightblue') |\u0026gt; gf_smooth(method = 'loess')  Estimating linear regression coefficients The linear regression coefficients can be estimated within any statistical software (or by hand, even if tedious). Within R, the primary function is lm() to estimate a linear regression. The primary argument is a formula similar to the regression formula shown above at the top of the notes.\nThis equation could be written more directly for our specific problem.\n$$ Avg_points = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} Minutes_Played + \\epsilon $$\n$$ Avg_points = 1.14 + .01 Minutes_Played + \\epsilon $$\nOne way to read this equation is that the number of minutes played for each player helps to understand variation or differences in the average points scored for that player. Or, average points is modeled or explained by minutes played.\nFor the R formula, instead of an $ = $, you could insert a ~.\nwnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg)  ## (Intercept) total_minutes ## 1.13562456 0.01014207  basketball \u0026lt;- basketball |\u0026gt; mutate(minutes_100 = total_minutes / 100)  gf_point(avg_points ~ minutes_100, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% #gf_smooth() %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'lightblue', size = 4) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  wnba_reg \u0026lt;- lm(avg_points ~ minutes_100, data = basketball) coef(wnba_reg)  ## (Intercept) minutes_100 ## 1.135625 1.014207  Interpretting linear regression terms Now that we have estimates for the linear regression terms, how are these interpretted? The linear regression equation with these estimates plugged in would look like the following:\n$$ \\hat{avg_points} = 1.1356 + .0101 min_played $$\nWhere instead of \\(\\beta_{0}\\) or \\(\\beta_{1}\\), the estimated values from this single season were inserted. Note the \\(\\hat{avg\\_points}\\), which the caret symbol is read as a hat, that is, average points hat, is a very important small distinction. This now represents the predicted values for the linear regression. That means, that the predicted value for the average number of points is assumed to function solely based on the minutes a player played. We could put in any value for the minutes played and get an estimated average number of points out.\n1.1356 + .0101 * 0  ## [1] 1.1356  1.1356 + .0101 * 1  ## [1] 1.1457  1.1356 + .0101 * 100  ## [1] 2.1456  1.1356 + .0101 * mean(basketball$avg_points)  ## [1] 1.189732  1.1356 + .0101 * 5000  ## [1] 51.6356  1.1356 + .0101 * -50  ## [1] 0.6306  Also notice from the equation above with the estimated coefficients, there is no longer any error. More on this later, but I wanted to point that out now. Back to model interpretations, these can become a bit more obvious with the values computed above by inputting specific values for the total minutes played.\nFirst, for the intercept ($\\beta_{0}$), notice that for the first computation above when 0 total minutes was input into the equation, that the same value for the intercept estimate was returned. This highlights what the intercept is, the average number of points scored when the X attribute (minutes played) equals 0.\nThe slope, ($\\beta_{1}$), term is the average change in the outcome (average points here) for a one unit change in the predictor attribute (minutes played). Therefore, the slope here is 0.0101, which means that the average points scores increases by about 0.01 points for every additional minute played. This effect is additive, meaning that the 0.01 for a one unit change, say from 100 to 101 minutes, will remain when increasing from 101 to 102 minutes.\nThe predictions coming from the linear regression are the same as the light blue dashed line shown in the figure above and recreated here without the dark blue line.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  What about the error? So far the error has been disregarded, but where did it go? The error didn\u0026rsquo;t disappear, it is actually in the figure just created above. Where can you see the error? Why was it disregarded when creating the predicted values?\nThe short answer is that the error in a linear regression is commonly assumed to follow a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Sometimes this is written in math notation as:\n$$ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) $$\nFrom this notation, can you see why the error was disregarded earlier when generating predictions?\nIn short, on average, the error is assumed to be 0 across all the sample data. The error will be smaller when the data are more closely clustered around the linear regression line and larger when the data are not clustered around the linear regression line. In the simple case with a single predictor, the error would be minimized when the correlation is closest to 1 in absolute value and largest when the correlation close to or equals 0.\nEstimating error in linear regression This comes from partitioning of variance that you maybe heard from a design of experiment or analysis of variance course. More specifically, the variance in the outcome can be partioned or split into two components, those that the independent attribute helped to explain vs those that it can not explain. The part that can be explained is sometimes referred to as the sum of squares regression (SSR), the portion that is unexplained is referred to as the sum of squares error (SSE). This could be written in math notation as:\n$$ \\sum (Y - \\bar{Y})^2 = \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 + \\sum (\\hat{Y} - \\bar{Y})^2 $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to visualize what this means.\ngf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + mean(avg_points) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = '#FF7F7F') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(avg_points + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = '#65a765') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  gf_point(avg_points ~ total_minutes, data = basketball, size = 4, alpha = .5) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~mean(avg_points), data = basketball) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'lm', linetype = 2, color = 'lightblue') %\u0026gt;% gf_segment(mean(avg_points) + fitted(wnba_reg) ~ total_minutes + total_minutes, data = basketball, color = '#FFD580') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Total Minutes Played\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Average Points Scored\u0026quot;)  Another related measure of error Another way to get a measure of how well the model is performing, would be a statistic called R-squared.

I will show two ways, one is general, the other is specific to this simple case with a single predictor/covariate attribute. In general, linear regression (or more generally the general linear model) uses least square estimation. This means that the the parameters in the model minimize the squared distance between the observed and predicted values. That is, least squares estimates minimize this criterion:\n$$ \\sum (Y - \\hat{Y})^2 $$\nSpecific example Calculus can be used to show that these two equations can be solved simultanuously to get estimates for \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) that minimize the criterion above. These formulas are:\n$$ b_{1} = \\frac{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})(Y - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X - \\bar{X})^2} $$ $$ b_{0} = \\bar{Y} - b_{1}\\bar{X} $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use R to get these quantities.\nb1 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind)) * (daily_aqi - mean(daily_aqi))) / sum((avg_wind - mean(avg_wind))^2) ) b0 \u0026lt;- with(airquality, mean(daily_aqi) - b1 * mean(avg_wind) ) b0  ## [1] 48.22295  b1  ## [1] -2.211798  coef(air_lm)  ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  General Approach When there are more than one predictor, the number of equations gets a bit unyieldy, therefore, there is a general analytic approach that works for any set of predictor attributes. The general approach uses matrix algebra (anyone take linear algebra?), to achieve their estimates. This general form is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{} \\mathbf{Y} \\right). $$ Where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector of estimated regression coefficients, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of covariate/predictor attributes (called the design matrix), and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is a vector of the outcome attribute.\nBelow, I show what these would look like for the air quality example that has been used and solve for the regression coefficients.\nX \u0026lt;- model.matrix(air_lm) head(X)  ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 1 1 2.941667 ## 2 1 2.445833 ## 3 1 1.995833 ## 4 1 3.445833 ## 5 1 1.116667 ## 6 1 6.091667  Y \u0026lt;- as.matrix(airquality$daily_aqi) head(Y)  ## [,1] ## [1,] 57 ## [2,] 54 ## [3,] 69 ## [4,] 56 ## [5,] 54 ## [6,] 22  X_X \u0026lt;- solve(t(X) %*% X) X_X  ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## (Intercept) 0.0008152474 -1.424894e-04 ## avg_wind -0.0001424894 3.340328e-05  X_Y \u0026lt;- t(X) %*% Y X_Y  ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 186997 ## avg_wind 731464  X_X %*% X_Y  ## [,1] ## (Intercept) 48.222946 ## avg_wind -2.211798  coef(air_lm)  ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  ","date":1662422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662422400,"objectID":"6d4c6b2f1edafa69103651e8be3cc641","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/lectures/03-regression-estimates/","publishdate":"2022-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/03-regression-estimates/","section":"lectures","summary":"Understanding Regression Parameters This section of notes aims to dig a bit more into what the simple linear regression (i.e., regression with a single continuous covariate/attribute) parameter estimates mean.

The reason inference is useful is based on the idea that for most problems the sample is used to approximate the population. Therefore, a subset of the population (the sample) is used to estimate the population parameters that are of most interest. As such, our estimates come with error and this uncertainty we can quantify when making inference about the parameter estimates.\nIn this course, I plan to show you two ways to perform this inference. One of those frameworks will be the classical approach which uses classical statistical theory to estimate the amount of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The second approach will use the bootstrap as a way to computationally estimate the uncertainty. The benefit of the bootstrap is that it comes with fewer assumptions than the classical approach. We will build up to these arguments.\nClassical Inferential Framework The classical inferential framework, sometimes referred to as the null hypothesis significance test (NHST) has been around for more than 100 years. This framework builds off of the idea of a null hypothesis.\nA null hypothesis is typically thought as a hypothesis that assumes there is no relationship or a null effect. Framing this in the regression concept that we have been working with, we could define the following null hypotheses.\n$$ H_{0}: \\beta_{0} = 0.\\ The\\ population\\ yintercept\\ equals\\ 0. $$\nor\n$$ H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = 0.\\ The\\ population\\ slope\\ equals\\ 0. $$\nIn the following two null hypotheses, represented with \\(H_{0}\\), the population parameters are being assumed to be 0 in the population. This is one definition of a null effect, but is not the only null effect we can define (more on this later). The value defined as a null effect is important as it centers the sampling distribution used for evaluating where the sample estimate falls in that distribution.\nAnother hypothesis is typically defined with the null hypothesis, called the alternative hypothesis. This hypothesis states that there is an effect. Within the linear regression framework, we could write the alternative hypotheses as:\n$$ H_{A}: \\beta_{0} \\neq 0.\\ The\\ population\\ yintercept\\ is\\ not\\ equal\\ to\\ 0. $$\nor\n$$ H_{A}: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0.\\ The\\ population\\ slope\\ is\\ not\\ equal\\ to\\ 0. $$\nIn the following two alternative hypotheses, represented with \\(H_{A}\\), the population parameters are assumed to be not equal to 0. These can also be one-sided, more on this with an example later.\nEstimating uncertainty in parameter estimates The standard error is used to estimate uncertainty or error in the parameter estimates due to having a sample from the population. More specifically, this means that the entire population is not used to estimate the parameter, therefore the estimate we have is very likely not equal exactly to the parameter. Instead, there is some sort of sampling error involved that we want to quantify. If the sample was collected well, ideally randomly, then the estimate should be unbiased. Unbiased here doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the estimate equals the population parameter, rather, that through repeated sampling, the average of our sample estimates would equal the population parameter.\nAs mentioned, standard errors are used to quantify this uncertainty. In the linear regression case we have explored so far, there are mathematical formula for the standard errors. These are shown below.\n$$ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{0} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{X}^2}{\\sum \\left( X - \\bar{X} \\right)^2} \\right)} $$\nand\n$$ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{1} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{\\sum \\left( X - \\bar{X} \\right)^2}} $$\nIn the equation above, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), is equal to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{error}}{n - 2}}\\), and \\(n\\) is the sample size (ie, number of rows of data in the model).\nMatrix Representation It is also possible, and more easily extendable, to write the standard error computations or the variance of the estimated parameters in matrix representation. This framework extends beyond the single predictor case (ie. one \\(X\\)), therefore is more readily used in practice.\n$$ \\hat{var}\\left({\\hat{\\beta}}\\right) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} $$\nIn the equation above, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), is equal to \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{error}}{n - 2}}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the design matrix from the regression analysis. Finally, to get the standard errors back, you take the square root of the diagonal elements.\n$$ SE\\left( \\hat{\\beta} \\right) = \\sqrt{diag\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{`}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1}\\right)} $$\nData The data for this section of notes will explore data from the Environmental Protection Agency on Air Quality collected for the state of Iowa in 2021.

There are two related pieces that can be computed now, a confidence interval and/or the test-statistic and p-value. Let\u0026rsquo;s go through both.\nFirst, a confidence interval can be computed. Confidence intervals take the following general form:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} \\pm C * SE $$\nWhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the parameter estimate, \\(C\\) is the confidence level, and \\(SE\\) is the standard error. The parameter estimates and standard errors are what we have already established, the \\(C\\) is the confidence level. This indicates the percentage of times, over the long run/repeated sampling, that the interval will capture the population parameter. Historically, this value is often specified as 95%, but any value is theoretically possible.\nThe \\(C\\) value represents a quantile from a mathematical distribution that separates the middle percetage desired (ie, 95%) from the rest of the distribution. The mathematical distribution is most often the t-distribution, but the difference between a t-distribution and normal distribution are modest once the sample size is greater than 30 or so.\nThe figure below tries to highlight the \\(C\\) value.\nt_30 \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(-5, 5, .01), density = dt(seq(-5, 5, .01), df = 30)) gf_line(density ~ value, data = t_30) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.025, df = 30), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.975, df = 30), linetype = 2)  coef(air_lm)  ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 48.222946 -2.211798  summary(air_lm)$coefficients[,2]  ## (Intercept) avg_wind ## 0.5155100 0.1043487  abs(qt(.025, df = nrow(airquality) -2))  ## [1] 1.960456  48.2 + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * .5155  ## [1] 47.18962 49.21038  -2.211 + c(-1, 1) * 1.96 * .1043  ## [1] -2.415428 -2.006572  Inference with test statistics It is also possible to do inference with a test statistic and computation of a p-value. Inference in this framework can be summarized into the following steps:\n Generate hypotheses, ie null and alternative hypotheses. Establish an \\(\\alpha\\) value Estimate parameters Compute test statistic Generate p-value  An \\(\\alpha\\) value is the level of significance and represents the probability of obtaining the results due to chance. This is a value that the researcher can select. For a 5% \\(\\alpha\\) value, this is what was used above to compute the confidence intervals.\nThe test statistic is computed as follows:\n$$ test\\ stat = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta} - hypothesized\\ value}{SE(\\hat{\\beta})} $$\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the estimated parameter, \\(SE(\\hat{\\beta})\\) is the standard error of the parameter estimate, and the \\(hypothesized\\ value\\) is the hypothesized value from the null hypothesis. This is often 0, but does not need to be zero.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume the following null/alternative hypotheses:\n$$ H_{0}: \\beta_{1} = 0 \\\nH_{A}: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0 $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use R to compute this test statistic.\nt = (-2.211 - 0) / .1043 t  ## [1] -21.19847  pt(-21.198, df = nrow(airquality) -2, lower.tail = TRUE)  ## [1] 1.003866e-95  t_dist \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(-25, 25, .05), density = dt(seq(-25, 25, .05), df = (nrow(airquality) - 2))) gf_line(density ~ value, data = t_dist) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.025, df = (nrow(airquality) - 2)), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ qt(.975, df = (nrow(airquality) - 2)), linetype = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ -21.198, color = 'red') %\u0026gt;% gf_vline(xintercept = ~ 21.198, color = 'red')  summary(air_lm)  ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = daily_aqi ~ avg_wind, data = airquality) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -41.71 -14.38 -0.73 12.43 86.84 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Finally,upload the final document to ICON.\nIncluding Statistical Evidence This assignment is worth a total of 10 points spread over 7 questions. Please make sure to include any statistical evidence to support your statements, this could include graphics or statistics. This assignment also gives you a choice about what question you are interested in exploring within these data, therefore, including the statistical evidence is extremely important. Failure to include statistical evidence to support claims will result in a 1pt deduction.\nDue Date Due around December 5th, 2021. No penalty for late submissions as long as it is submitted by December 11th.\nThe data for this assignment is fertility data for countries. The data originally were compiled from a variety of sources such as the World Bank and comes from a colleague of mine who uses the data in their class.\nData to use: The data can be obtained in csv format from GitHub. The data are also posted to the data folder within the IDAS. A short description for each attribute is as follows.\n   variable class description     country character Country Name   region character Region of the world (7 total)   fertility_rate double Average number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific fertility rates.   educ_female double Average number of years of formal education (schooling) for females   infant_mortality double Number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births in a given year.   contraceptive double Percentage of women who are practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, any form of contraception. It is usually measured for women ages 15–49 who are married or in union.   gni_class character Categorization based on country’s gross national income per capita (calculated using the World Bank Atlas method); Low = Low-income economies; GNI per capita of $1,025 or less, Low/Middle = Lower-middle-income economies; GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; Upper/Middle = Upper middle-income economies; GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; Upper = High-income economies; GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.   high_gni double Dummy variable indicating if the country is has an upper-middle or high income economy (low- or low/middle-income = 0; upper/middle or upper income = 1)   region_simple character Region of the world, simplified. North/South America are combined and South Asia is combined with East Asia and Pacific (5 total regions)    Note This is a new assignment that does not build off of the first two assignments in the course.\nQuestions Note: Each question is worth 1 pt unless otherwise specified.\n  Using the data descriptions above, create a research question to explore for this assignment that includes a categorical predictor. Explore the research question from #1 descriptively. Summarize key similarities/differences from the descriptive analysis. Note, for this first part, include just a single categorical predictor in your research questions.\n  Fit a linear regression model to explore the research question from #1. Interpret each regression coefficient estimate from the linear regression model. That is, what do the specific linear regression coefficients mean in the context of the data problem at hand?\n  Evaluate the linear regression data conditions/assumptions for the model fitted in #3. Summarize the degree to which the model meets the statistical assumptions of linear regression.\n  Summarize the statistical evidence to answer the research question from #1. Be as specific as possible about which tests you are exploring and whether the statistical evidence supports or does not support the null hypothesis.\n  Add any predictors you think may help increase the utility of the statistical model fitted as main effects/additive effects. Note, you are welcome to include more than one attribute in this step, but include at least one. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s not consider any interactions, make sure the terms are additive.\n Perform model comparisons to identify the extent to which this second model performs better than the first model fitted in #3. Summarize the evidence for which model is fitting the data the best. Do the primary conclusions from the model fitted in #3 differ for the first categorical attribute considered?    Attempt to create a figure that captures/summarizes the key takeaway from the statistical results/conclusions from #8. Why did you choose this figure to highlight the statistical results/conclusions?\n  Part 2  Explore an interaction between two categorical attributes.\n Interpret the interaction estimate. That is, what do the parameter estimates mean in the context of the data? Note: I recommend including at most a two-way interaction effect (i.e., an interaction between two attributes) to promote interpretability here. Also, as part of the interpretation, what does the statistical evidence suggest about whether the interaction effect differs from 0?    Create a figure that summarizes the key statistical results from the model from #7. In a few sentences, describe why this figure is appropriate to summarize the statistical results.\n  Build a new model that adds a new interaction effect between a categorical and a continuous attribute (ensure both terms are included as main effects as well). Note, this model could be the one that you built in part 1 of this assignment, for example with #5. I recommend to aid in interpretability for this assignment, just include one categorical, one continuous, and the interaction effect.\n Interpret the interaction estimate, that is, what does the interaction parameter estimate mean in the context of the data? As part of the intepretation, what does the statistical evidence suggest about whether the interaction effect differs from 0?    Create a figure that summarizes the key statistical results from the model from #9. In a few sentences, describe why this figure is appropriate to summarize the statistical results.\n  ","date":1667520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667520000,"objectID":"6e81801222a7818e1b83b93e282b1f92","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/assignments/assignment/assignment3/","publishdate":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/assignment/assignment3/","section":"assignments","summary":"The following assignment is aimed to give you some practice with exploring data and running a linear regression on your own using statistical software.

Residuals are defined as:\n$$ Y - \\hat{Y} $$\nThese are the deviations in the observed scores from the predicted scores from the linear regression. Recall, through least square estimation that these residauls will sum to 0, therefore, their mean would also be equal to 0. However, there are certain conditions about these residuals that are made for the linear regression model to have the inferences be appropriate. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about what the implications for violating these conditions will have on the linear regression model, but first, the conditions.\n Approximately Normally distributed residuals Homogeneity of variance Uncorrelated residuals Error term is uncorrelated with the predictor attribute Linearity and additivity of the model.  Each of these will be discussed in turn.\nData conditions that are not directly testable:\n Validity Representativeness  Approximately Normally distributed residuals The first assumption is that the residuals are at least approximately Normally distributed. This assumption is really only much of a concern when the sample size is small. If the sample size is larger, the Central Limit Thereom (CLT) states that the distribution of the statstics will be approximately normally distributed. The threshold for the CLT to be properly invoked is about 30. Larger then this, the residuals do not need to be approximately normally distributed. Even still, exploring the distribution of the residuals can still be helpful and can also be helpful to identify potential extreme values.\nThis example will make use of the air quality data one more time.\nData The data for this section of notes will explore data from the Environmental Protection Agency on Air Quality collected for the state of Iowa in 2021.

Homoogeneity of variance is an assumption that states that the variance of the residuals are similar across the predicted or fitted values from the regression line. This assumption can be explored by looking at the residuals (standardized or raw residuals), by the fitted or predicted values. Within this plot, the range of residuals should be similar across the range of fitted or predicted values.\ngf_point(.resid ~ .fitted, data = resid_diagnostics, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'loess', size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = 'Fitted Values', y = 'Residuals')  gf_point(.std.resid ~ .fitted, data = resid_diagnostics, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'loess', size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = 'Fitted Values', y = 'Standardized Residuals')  Another figure that can also be helpful for the homogeneity of variance assumption is one that rescales the residuals on the y-axis. The rescaling makes all the standardized residuals positive (takes the absolute value) and then takes the square root of this.\nresid_diagnostics %\u0026gt;% mutate(sqrt_abs_sresid = sqrt(abs(.std.resid))) %\u0026gt;% gf_point(sqrt_abs_sresid ~ .fitted, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_smooth(method = 'loess', size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = 'Fitted Values', y = 'Sqrt Abs Standardized Residuals')  Data with high leverage Data with high leverage are extreme values that may significantly impact the regression estimates. These statistics include extreme values for the outcome or predictor attributes. Cook\u0026rsquo;s distance is one statistic that can help to identify points with high impact/leverage for the regression estimates. Cook\u0026rsquo;s distance is a statistic that represents how much change there would be in the fitted values if the point was removed when estimating the regression coefficients. There is some disagreement between what type of thresholds to use for Cook\u0026rsquo;s distance, but one rule of thumb is Cook\u0026rsquo;s distance greater than 1. There has also been some research showing that Cook\u0026rsquo;s distance follows an F-distribution, so a more specific value could be computed. The rule of thumb for greater than 1 comes from the F distribution for large samples.\nresid_diagnostics %\u0026gt;% mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) %\u0026gt;% gf_col(.cooksd ~ obs_num, fill = 'black', color = 'black') %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Observation Number\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Cook's Distance\u0026quot;)  Another leave one out statistic is the studentized deleted residuals. These are computed by removing a data point, refitting the regression model, then generate a predicted value for the X value for the data point removed. Then the residual is computed the same as before and is standardized like the standardized residuals above. The function in R to compute these is rstudent().\nhead(rstudent(air_lm))  ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.8465904 0.6196587 1.3956793 0.8529524 0.4568561 -0.7062271  airquality$student_residuals \u0026lt;- rstudent(air_lm) head(airquality)  ## # A tibble: 6 × 15 ## date id poc pm2.5 daily_aqi site_…¹ aqs_p…² cbsa_…³ cbsa_…⁴ county ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1/1/21 190130009 1 15.1 57 Water … PM2.5 … 47940 Waterl… Black… ## 2 1/4/21 190130009 1 13.3 54 Water … PM2.5 … 47940 Waterl… Black… ## 3 1/7/21 190130009 1 20.5 69 Water … PM2.5 … 47940 Waterl… Black… ## 4 1/10/21 190130009 1 14.3 56 Water … PM2.5 … 47940 Waterl… Black… ## 5 1/13/21 190130009 1 13.7 54 Water … PM2.5 … 47940 Waterl… Black… ## 6 1/16/21 190130009 1 5.3 22 Water … PM2.5 … 47940 Waterl… Black… ## # … with 5 more variables: avg_wind \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, max_wind \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # max_wind_hours \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, residuals \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, student_residuals \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, and ## # abbreviated variable names ¹​site_name, ²​aqs_parameter_desc, ³​cbsa_code, ## # ⁴​cbsa_name  airquality %\u0026gt;% mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) %\u0026gt;% gf_point(student_residuals ~ obs_num, size = 5, alpha = .15) %\u0026gt;% gf_hline(yintercept = ~ 3, color = 'blue', size = 2) %\u0026gt;% gf_labs(x = \u0026quot;Observation Number\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Studentized Residuals\u0026quot;)  Leverage can be another measure to help detect outliers in X values. The hat values that were computed from the augment() function above and can be interpreted as the distance the X scores are from the center of all X predictors. In the case of a single predictor, the hat values are the distance the X score is from the mean of X.

That is, there is a test statistic that aims to test if the model is explaining variation over and above a simple mean. More specifically, this omnibus hypothesis tests the following:\n$$ H_{0}: All\\ \\beta = 0 \\[10pt] H_{A}: Any\\ \\beta \\neq 0 $$\nThis hypothesis can be formally tested with an F-statistic which is distributed as an F distribution with \\(p\\) predictor attributes and \\(n - p - 1\\) degrees of freedom.\nf_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(0, 5, by = .01)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(dens = df(value, 2, 1278)) gf_line(dens ~ value, data = f_data, size = 2)  f_data \u0026lt;- data.frame(value = seq(0, 5, by = .01)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(dens = df(value, 5, 50)) gf_line(dens ~ value, data = f_data, size = 2)  Adjusted R-squared The adjusted R-squared is typically used when comparing models. This statistic is commonly used as R-square represents the ratio between explained and total variance, therefore, this will always increase, even if the new attribute entered is not helpful. The adjusted R-squared tries to adjust for model complexity. There are many ways to do this, but the most common will be defined here.\n$$ \\bar{R}^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) \\frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1} $$\nor\n$$ \\bar{R}^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res} / df_{e}}{SS_{tot} / df_{t}} $$ where \\(p\\) is the number of predictors (excluding the intercept), \\(n\\) is the sample size, \\(SS_{e}\\) and \\(SS_{tot}\\) are sum of square residual and total respectively, and \\(df_{e}\\) and \\(df_{t}\\) are degrees of freedom for the error ($n - p - 1$) and total ($n - 1$) respectively.\nsummary(adm_mult_reg)  ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = adm_rate ~ act_mean + cost_mean, data = college) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.65484 -0.12230 0.02291 0.13863 0.37054 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We need a new representation of the categorical attribute, enter dummy or indicator coding.\nDummy/Indicator Coding Suppose we use the following logic:\nIf NL, then give a value of 1, else give a value of 0.\nDoes this give the same information as before?\n   League ID Dummy League ID     AL 0   NL 1    What would this look like for the actual data?\ncareer \u0026lt;- career %\u0026gt;% mutate(league_dummy = ifelse(lgID == 'NL', 1, 0)) head(career, n = 10)  ## # A tibble: 10 × 6 ## name lgID H AB average league_dummy ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Jeff Abbott AL 127 459 0.277 0 ## 2 Kurt Abbott AL 33 123 0.268 0 ## 3 Kurt Abbott NL 455 1780 0.256 1 ## 4 Reggie Abercrombie NL 54 255 0.212 1 ## 5 Brent Abernathy AL 194 767 0.253 0 ## 6 Shawn Abner AL 81 309 0.262 0 ## 7 Shawn Abner NL 19 115 0.165 1 ## 8 Bobby Abreu AL 858 3061 0.280 0 ## 9 Bobby Abreu NL 1602 5373 0.298 1 ## 10 Jose Abreu AL 1262 4353 0.290 0  Now that there is a numeric attribute, these can be added into the linear regression model.\naverage_lm \u0026lt;- lm(average ~ league_dummy, data = career) broom::tidy(average_lm)  ## # A tibble: 2 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.253 0.000761 332. 0 ## 2 league_dummy 0.00102 0.00107 0.949 0.343  How are these terms interpreted now?\ndf_stats(average ~ league_dummy, data = career, mean, sd, length)  ## response league_dummy mean sd length ## 1 average 0 0.2525899 0.02876352 1431 ## 2 average 1 0.2536090 0.02879563 1440  average_lm2 \u0026lt;- lm(average ~ lgID, data = career) broom::tidy(average_lm2)  ## # A tibble: 2 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.253 0.000761 332. 0 ## 2 lgIDNL 0.00102 0.00107 0.949 0.343  t.test(average ~ lgID, data = career, var.equal = TRUE)  ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: average by lgID ## t = -0.9487, df = 2869, p-value = 0.3429 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group AL and group NL is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.003125489 0.001087227 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group AL mean in group NL ## 0.2525899 0.2536090  Values other than 0/1 First, I want to build off of the first part of the notes on regression with categorical predictors.

In a few sentences, summarize key elements of the relationship between price and distance. You may wish to include the following elements of the association, strength, direction, and/or form.\n  Does the association between price and distance of rides appear to be linear? Why or why not?\n  Fit a linear regression to answer the research question highlighted above. Interpret the intercept and slope of the linear regression. That is, what do these terms mean?\n  What are the r-squared and sigma estimates from the linear regression? Interpret these two values in the context of the problem. That is, what do these two terms mean in the context of the data and this problem?\n  Finally, in a couple sentences, provide a summary of the overall model. Does the model appear to be useful to predict the price of a ride with only the distance of the ride?

Rephrasing slightly, could the intercept term be made more interpretable? If so, how?\n  Fit a modified linear regression that performs a centering. That is, center the distance in some fashion. Options could include, minimum, mean, median, maximum, etc centering. What changed for the estimates obtained from the model?\n Which model, the centered or the uncentered, do you feel has a stronger justification for its usage? Be as specific as possible in your rationale.    Use whichever model you feel is the best from #3, then extract from software or compute the standard errors for the estimated regression coefficients. Interpret these standard errors in the context of the problem.\n  Compute confidence intervals for the two regression coefficients. Justify your choice for level of confidence and interpret the confidence interval.\n  Finally, perform hypothesis testing for the two regression coefficients. In this, set up the null/alternative hypotheses and then interpret the statistical results to provide a statistical conclusion. More specifically, what does the hypothesis test suggest about the null and alternative hypotheses?\n The first part talked about the statistical conclusions, now compare/contrast this with practical conclusions. More specifically, would these results be useful in practice? Be as specific as possible in your response.

Perform a descriptive analysis on these residuals. This could include graphically visualizing the distribution and/or computing summary statistics on the residuals.\n  Evaluate the residuals for the assumption of normality of the residuals. How may the results be impacted by any deviation of normality?\n  Evaluate the residuals for the assumption of homogeneity of variance. How may the results be impacted by any deviation of homogeneity of variance?\n  Are there any noticeable trends in the residuals? What implications could this have for the analysis? If a trend in the residuals exists, what may be a cause for this trend?\n  Explore the model to identify if there are any points that have high leverage or could be identified as extreme values. It may be worth exploring studentized residuals, cook\u0026rsquo;s distance, and/or leverage values.\n  ","date":1666051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666051200,"objectID":"5332526da9a7c6e4edea1e846b3d68ba","permalink":"https://psqf6243.brandonlebeau.org/assignments/activity/activity4/","publishdate":"2022-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/activity/activity4/","section":"assignments","summary":"The following activity is aimed to give you some practice with exploring data and running a linear regression on your own using statistical software.

After controlling for the square footage of the rental, does the number of bedrooms help explain any additional variation in the price of the rental?  Questions   Explore descriptively any relationship between square footage and price of the rental. Summarize the relationship in a couple sentences.\n  Fit a model to explore research question 1, summarize in a few sentences the primary regression estimates.\n  There are two ways to estimate this model, treat number of bedrooms as continuous or as a factor. Fit this model in both ways: a. Treat bedrooms as continuous (simply add bedrooms into the model). b. Treat bedrooms as a categorical/ordinal attribute. In R, you can do this with the following code: factor(beds) in the model equation.\n  Interpret the regression estimates for the effect of number of bedrooms from each model in #3.\n  What is a key difference in the assumed form of the relationship between both models in #3?\n  Perform model comparisons for the 3 models fitted in this activity. That is, compare the following models:\n square footage only square footage with continuous bedrooms square footage with categorical/ordinal bedrooms. Identify for each model comparison if the model is nested or not nested and interpret the appropriate model comparison measure.
