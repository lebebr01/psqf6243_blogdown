Students are assumed to have some background in statistical concepts and have a basic understanding of common descriptive statistics and bivariate association (e.g., Pearson correlation).\nThis course will focus on using statistical methods to answer research questions and make decisions from data. General linear models (i.e., regression) will serve as the fundamental building block that students will be exposed to answer questions about associations of quantitative outcomes with quantitative and categorical predictors. Statistical estimation, model building, and inference using statistical software will serve as primary topics which students will gain a stronger understanding by the end of the course.\nCourse Objectives The course requirements and class materials are aimed to help students achieve the following course objectives:\n become more fluent in statistical terminology, use statistical software, turn research questions into actionable statistical methods, engage with statistical theory, connect model equations with statistical code, summarize uncertainty and variation in estimation.

Online access via library: https://dx-doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.4135/9781483396774.n1.   Class notes and Jupyter Notebooks used in class will also be shared through the course website.  Course Requirements   Online Quizzes: There will be a total of 8 to 10 online quizzes taken through ICON. Each quiz will be available for about 5 days and are open note/book, but should be completed independently and will need to be completed in a single occasion. The dates will be discussed in class and announcements will be sent by email to communicate when quizzes open and close. Quizzes will generally be due on Sunday evenings.\n  Exams: There will also be two exams taken on ICON. One exam will be around midterm time and the second will be during final exam week. The online exams will be about 20 questions and will be open book/note. The exams will be available for at least 5 days, just like the quizzes and should be completed independently.\n  Assignments: 4 total assignments spread throughout the course will be used to improve student understanding and give students practice to work with data. These assignments can be completed within small groups of no more than 3 students. If completed as a group, all students will receive the same score and only one assignment with everyone\u0026rsquo;s name on it needs to be turned in.\n  Activities: 4 to 6 activities will be posted across the semester. These are pass/fail activities, therefore, completing these will give you 10% of the final course grade. Completion of these is posting answers to the questions that show you interacted and engaged in the activity. Answers that are not on topic or missing will not count as \u0026ldquo;passing\u0026rdquo; that given activity. These activities are meant to be formative assessments to give you time to practice interpreting statistics. Similar to the assignments, you may work in groups of up to 3 to complete these activities, in which you would all receive the same pass/fail grade for the activity.\n  Absences: Absences happen. Therefore, I ask you to be as transparent as possible with me. I promise to be compassionate and understanding. If at any point in the semester you are having difficulties, please reach out to me and I will do my best to be accommodating and provide support, which could include an extension on course deadlines as necessary.\n  Grading: Final grades will be based on the following weighting scheme:\n 8 to 10 quizzes, equally weighted, 30% of total grade 2 exams, equally weighted, 30% of total grade 4 assignments, equally weighted, 30% of total grade 4 to 6 activities, equally weighted, 10% of total grade    Percentage Breakdown: Guidelines are given below, plus and minus grades will be given as well. Changes may occur to the grade percentage breakdown below, but the percentages will not get higher. For example, the lower percentage to get a B, could drop to 75%, but will never be higher than 80%. I will do my best to communicate any shifts to these grade ranges as the semester progresses.\n A 90% and above B 80% up to 90% C 70% up to 80% D Below 70%    Course and University Policies  Announcements and Communication: Any announcements regarding the course will be communicated via e-mail so please check it daily. Course materials will be posted to ICON. Go to icon.uiowa.edu for access to the ICON site. Adaptations and Modifications: Please inform me during the first two weeks if you require special adaptations or modifications to any assignment or due dates because of special circumstances such as learning disabilities, religious observances, or other appropriate needs. Contesting a Grade: To contest a grade, please send me an e-mail detailing your reason within 48 hours of receiving the grade. This allows both of us time to think, reflect, and discuss the matter without taking class time from other students. When contesting a grade, provide a copy of the graded assignment. Academic Misconduct: Plagiarism and cheating may result in grade reduction and/or serious penalties. Unless you are otherwise instructed, your work should be entirely your own. Please take care in writing your final project. You should always be writing in your own words, citing others' ideas, and quoting text as appropriate. This link provides the College of Education policy on student academic misconduct (plagiarism and cheating) https://education.uiowa.edu/coe-policies/student-academic-misconduct. Free Speech and Expression: The University of Iowa supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principles of academic and artistic freedom. We are committed to open inquiry, vigorous debate, and creative expression inside and outside of the classroom. Visit the Free Speech at Iowa website for more information on the university’s policies on free speech and academic freedom. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The University is committed to providing an educational experience that is accessible to all students. If a student has a diagnosed disability or other disabling condition that may impact the student’s ability to complete the course requirements as stated in the syllabus, the student may seek accommodations through Student Disability Services (SDS). SDS is responsible for making Letters of Accommodation (LOA) available to the student. The student must provide a LOA to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, but requests not made at least two weeks prior to the scheduled activity for which an accommodation is sought may not be accommodated. The LOA will specify what reasonable course accommodations the student is eligible for and those the instructor should provide. Additional information can be found on the SDS website. Absences for Religious Holy Days: The University is prepared to make reasonable accommodations for students whose religious holy days coincide with their classroom assignments, test schedules, and classroom attendance expectations. Students must notify their instructors in writing of any such Religious Holy Day conflicts or absences within the first few days of the semester or session, and no later than the third week of the semester. If the conflict or absence will occur within the first three weeks of the semester, the student should notify the instructor as soon as possible. See Operations Manual 8.2 Absences for Religious Holy Days for additional information. Classroom Expectations: Students are expected to comply with University policies regarding appropriate classroom behavior as outlined in the Code of Student Life. While students have the right to express themselves and participate freely in class, it is expected that students will behave with the same level of courtesy and respect in the virtual class setting (whether asynchronous or synchronous) as they would in an in-person classroom. Failure to follow behavior expectations as outlined in the Code of Student Life may be addressed by the instructor and may also result in discipline under the Code of Student Life policies governing E.5 Disruptive Behavior or E.6 Failure to Comply with University Directive. Non-Discrimination Statement: The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, creed, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, pregnancy, disability, genetic information, status as a U.S. veteran, service in the U.S. military, sexual orientation, gender identity, associational preferences, or any other classification that deprives a person of consideration as an individual (https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/community-policies/human-rights). For more information, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (https://diversity.uiowa.edu/eod, or 319-335-0705, or diversity@uiowa.edu). Students may share their pronouns and chosen/preferred names in MyUI, which is accessible to instructors and advisors. Sexual Harassment/Sexual Misconduct and Supportive Measures: The University of Iowa prohibits all forms of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and related retaliation. The Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct governs actions by students, faculty, staff and visitors. Incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct can be reported to the Title IX and Gender Equity Office or to the Department of Public Safety. Students impacted by sexual harassment or sexual misconduct may be eligible for academic supportive measures and can learn more by contacting the Title IX and Gender Equity Office. Information about confidential resources can be found here. Watch the video for an explanation of these resources. Mental Health: Students are encouraged to be mindful of their mental health and seek help as a preventive measure or if feeling overwhelmed and/or struggling to meet course expectations. Students are encouraged to talk to their instructor for assistance with specific class-related concerns. For additional support and counseling, students are encouraged to contact University Counseling Service (UCS).
